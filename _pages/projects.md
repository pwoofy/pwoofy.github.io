### Roblox API Scanner

I made [this project](https://github.com/pwoofy/API-Scanner/) specifically for Roblox puzzling. Usually, when you do Roblox puzzles, sometimes there would be a puzzle that involves messing around with the API, which is admittedly annoying because the traditional method required you to go to each API page, and input numbers in it.

Not cool. 

So I made this project, which basically simplifies API Scanning to just inputting an ID, then it will automatically scrape **ALL** APIs related to it.

Instructions are provided in the github page.
