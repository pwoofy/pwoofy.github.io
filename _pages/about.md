<h2> INTRO </h2>
---
i am a furry. yes, crazy. my OC is a protogen-cat hybrid sona, though you'll probably see the protogen sona more often.
i don't draw, but i try to draw my friends sometimes. i commission artists a lot, though.

---
<h2> NERD STUFF BOO </h2>
---

i do engineering (chemistry ftw, also biochem is cool), but i also do coding stuff. you can see my projects in the projects tab, where i made some puzzle helper & a discord bot.

also, i do ctfs. you will see ctf writeups here sometimes. nerd out. hmu if you're a furry ctfer, we (as in, myself) need more fuzzy tech furries around.

i also volunteer for organizations, most notable feat was mentoring students in writing academic essays (and oo, they got accepted to good unis worldwide!)
