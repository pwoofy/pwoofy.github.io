<div class="puzzle-entry" >
    <h2>ExamplePuzzle</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty: </li>
        <li>Personal Difficulty: </li>
        It's worth noting that if I write the personal difficulty as XYZ (ABC), the XYZ means that I'm considering in it as a whole, and ABC means that I'm considering it for just the puzzle.

<h2>Spawn Shark [#26]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 939</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 728</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Use TeleportToSpawnByName to spawn at a SpawnLocation called 'Shark'."</li>
<li>Personal Opinion: I only rated this as lower because I had already known about this method before.</li>
<li>Unlocks: Void Chair</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways one would start tackling this one. The most obvious is the title itself, "Spawn" "Shark". Considering the nature of Roblox Secret Games, we can roughly have the idea that this is something rather technical. Knowing this, if we go through the Roblox API github page and search up spawn, we can find a TeleportService method, which is TeleportToSpawnByName.</p>

```lua
local TPS = game:GetService("TeleportService")
script.Parent.Touched:Connect(function(Hit)
    TPS:TeleportToSpawnByName(137630300324059, 'Shark', game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(Hit.Parent))
end)

    <h2>Heartless [#27]</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty: 355</li>
        <li>Personal Difficulty: 105</li>
        <li>Official Solution: "Throw the valentine into the void."</li>
        <li>Unlocks: 💔 </li>
    </ul>
    <p>"Heartless" implies that you have to do something with the heart. If you have a subspace tripmine, you can easily blow up the valentines on accident, which means that this is much easier of a secret than its written!</p>

<h2>Superstar [#28]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 815</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 802</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Favorite Work at a Pizza Place's 'Cook' badge."</li>
<li>Bullshit Meter: 5/10 like what the fuck ok</li>
<li>Unlocks: Star Pie</li>
</ul>
This one was a bit tricky for me. I always had the idea of favoriting something (Superstar is a reference to star. You obtain star by favoriting the game), but I'm not sure what it was. However, seeing as the star was inside the Badger, I realized that it might have something to do with favoriting a badge. However, Roblox has removed the feature to favorite a badge.<br><br> So I tried to search for how to prompt a player to favorite something. Then eventually I stumbled across [this post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/is-there-any-way-to-prompt-a-player-to-favorite-the-game/2717433). I realized that you can use AvatarEditorService:PromptSetFavorite to set a favorite, so I thought to myself: Why not try this with badges? So I came up with the following script:

```lua
local AvatarEditorService = game:GetService("AvatarEditorService")

local assetIds = {
	423842212,
	176686088,
	174605653,
	100158288,
	228602359,
	261773289,
	203066506,
	19391753,
	146093003,
	378631273,
}

for _, assetId in ipairs(assetIds) do
	print("Sending: " .. assetId)

	local success, result = pcall(function()
		game:GetService("AvatarEditorService"):PromptSetFavorite(assetId, Enum.AvatarItemType.Asset, true)
	end)

	if not success then
		warn("Failed: " .. assetId .. " | Error: " .. result)
	end

	task.wait(10) 
end

print("Finished prompting for all assets.")
```
<p>Now, you might have thought, why did I put so much asset IDs here? The answer to that is: I DONT KNOW!!! I DONT KNOW WHICH BADGE WORKED SO I PUT EVERYTHING IN! Eventually you unlock the solution and see that WAAPP's badge is needed. Not sure why, but cool.</p>

    <h2>MY EYES!!!!!!!!! [#29]</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty: 509</li>

        <li>Official Solution: "Set the weather machine to maximum brightness."</li>
        <li>Unlocks: Cool Sunglasses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can solve this by just fucking around with the weather machine you obtained from Task Master.</p>

<div class="puzzle-entry" >
    <h2>Comeuppance [#30]</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty: 825</li>
        <li>Personal Difficulty: 750 (620)</li>
        <li>Official Solution: "Get the eye to laser the laughing emoji."</li>
        <li>Unlocks: A Game Of Secrets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You all had it easy. Comeuppance used to have no badge, so I just thought that since comeuppance is a "deserved penalty", what in the map deserves a penalty from the eye? The laughing face. This just means that you should shoot the laughing emoji. However, since there is a badge now, you can just use your logic to shoot it.</p>

    <h2>6 times 2 [#31]</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty: 555</li>

        <li>Official Solution: "Complete the Mr. Angry '#%!&' puzzle."</li>
        <li>Unlocks: Trinitrotoluene</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have messed around with the Angry Emoji, you can realize you can click on it and it will turn. Through logical deduction, we can figure out that #%!& translates to 3517, because if you press Shift+3, you get #, and so on and so forth. You use the angry face as an input.</p>
