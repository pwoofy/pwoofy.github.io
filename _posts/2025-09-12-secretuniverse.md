ALL SECRETS WILL FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>ExamplePuzzle</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: </li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: </li>

<li>Official Solution: </li>
<li>Unlocks: </li>
</ul>
The following are optional, and won't show up in the explanation of all secrets:

<h2>Spawn Shark [#26]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 939</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 728</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Use TeleportToSpawnByName to spawn at a SpawnLocation called 'Shark'."</li>
<li>Personal Opinion: I only rated this as lower because I had already known about this method before.</li>
<li>Unlocks: Void Chair</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways one would start tackling this one. The most obvious is the title itself, "Spawn" "Shark". Considering the nature of Roblox Secret Games, we can roughly have the idea that this is something rather technical. Knowing this, if we go through the Roblox API github page and search up spawn, we can find a TeleportService method, which is TeleportToSpawnByName.</p>

```lua
local TPS = game:GetService("TeleportService")
script.Parent.Touched:Connect(function(Hit)
TPS:TeleportToSpawnByName(137630300324059, 'Shark', game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(Hit.Parent))
end)
```

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>Heartless [#27]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 355</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 105</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Throw the valentine into the void."</li>
<li>Unlocks: 💔 </li>
</ul>
<p>"Heartless" implies that you have to do something with the heart. If you have a subspace tripmine, you can easily blow up the valentines on accident, which means that this is much easier of a secret than its written!</p>
</div>

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>Superstar [#28]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 815</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 802</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Favorite Work at a Pizza Place's 'Cook' badge."</li>
<li>Bullshit Meter: 5/10 like what the fuck ok</li>
<li>Unlocks: Star Pie</li>
</ul>
This one was a bit tricky for me. I always had the idea of favoriting something (Superstar is a reference to star. You obtain star by favoriting the game), but I'm not sure what it was. However, seeing as the star was inside the Badger, I realized that it might have something to do with favoriting a badge. However, Roblox has removed the feature to favorite a badge.<br><br> So I tried to search for how to prompt a player to favorite something. Then eventually I stumbled across [this post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/is-there-any-way-to-prompt-a-player-to-favorite-the-game/2717433). I realized that you can use AvatarEditorService:PromptSetFavorite to set a favorite, so I thought to myself: Why not try this with badges? So I came up with the following script:

```lua
local AvatarEditorService = game:GetService("AvatarEditorService")

local assetIds = {
	423842212,
	176686088,
	174605653,
	100158288,
	228602359,
	261773289,
	203066506,
	19391753,
	146093003,
	378631273,
}

for _, assetId in ipairs(assetIds) do
	print("Sending: " .. assetId)

	local success, result = pcall(function()
		game:GetService("AvatarEditorService"):PromptSetFavorite(assetId, Enum.AvatarItemType.Asset, true)
	end)

	if not success then
		warn("Failed: " .. assetId .. " | Error: " .. result)
	end

	task.wait(10) 
end

print("Finished prompting for all assets.")
```
<p>Now, you might have thought, why did I put so much asset IDs here? The answer to that is: I DONT KNOW!!! I DONT KNOW WHICH BADGE WORKED SO I PUT EVERYTHING IN! Eventually you unlock the solution and see that WAAPP's badge is needed. Not sure why, but cool.</p>

<h2>MY EYES!!!!!!!!! [#29]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 509</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 403 (10)</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Set the weather machine to maximum brightness."</li>
<li>Unlocks: Cool Sunglasses</li>
</ul>
<p>You can solve this by just fucking around with the weather machine you obtained from Task Master.</p>

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>Comeuppance [#30]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 825</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 750 (620)</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Get the eye to laser the laughing emoji."</li>
<li>Unlocks: A Game Of Secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>You all had it easy. Comeuppance used to have no badge icon, so I just thought that since comeuppance is a "deserved penalty", what in the map deserves a penalty from the eye? The laughing face. This just means that you should shoot the laughing emoji. However, since there is a badge now, you can just use your logic to shoot it.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>6 times 2 [#31]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 555</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 555</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Complete the Mr. Angry '#%!&' puzzle."</li>
<li>Unlocks: Trinitrotoluene</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have messed around with the Angry Emoji, you can realize you can click on it and it will turn. Through logical deduction, we can figure out that #%!& translates to 3517, because if you press Shift+3, you get #, and so on and so forth. You use the angry face as an input, but you interpret the angry face as a clock. To go from 12 to 3, you press 3 times. To go from 3 to 5, you press 2 times. To go from 5 to 1, you press 8 (5+8 = 13 - 12 = 1) times, and to go from 1 to 7, you press 6 times. Thus, the input code is 3286</p>

<li>Personal Difficulty: 820 (300)</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Survive the Demon Core's explosion."</li>
<li>Unlocks: Secrets Are Everywhere</li>
</ul>
<p>You can kind of realize that your goal is to survive when you first detonated the Demon Core that you get from solving Compound Nouns. You can realize that you can survive this after a certain height in the infinitower.</p>
</div>

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">

<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 989</li>

<li>Personal Difficulty: 200</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Hit a checkpoint in the easy obby while dead."</li>
<li>Unlocks: Indoor Obby</li>
</ul>
<p>You can figure out from the badge icon that you have to do something with resetting character (hence, post-mortem). The only place you can sort of die while hitting a finish line is by dying while hitting a checkpoint.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>Random Number Generation [#35]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 277</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 30</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Touch the Rainberge which spawns on the baseplate with a 1/1000 chance every second"</li>
<li>Unlocks: Super Secret Checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>The server will randomly send a message saying the Rainberge has spawned. You just have to find it in the map.</p>

<h2>Sharpshooter [#36]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 401</li>

<li>Official Solution: "Walk the plank on floor 10 of the Infinitower and hit a bullseye on the 'Target' Structure"</li>
<li>Unlocks: Running Track</li>
</ul>
<p>This is something you kinda have to try out for yourself. You'll figure out logically that you can drop to the bullseye from any height.</p>
</div>

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>Hackerman [#37]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 60</li>

<li>Official Solution: "Open the developer console"</li>
<li>Personal Opinion: No way this shit is a 60 wtf</li>
<li>Unlocks: RandomMoneyMaker 9000™</li>

<h2>Ultraviolet [#38]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 789</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 840</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Equip body colors visible on the statue through the magnifying glass while the game window is unfocused."</li>
<li>Bullshit Meter: 7/10</li>
<li>Personal Opinion: BULLSHIT</li>
<li>Unlocks: Baseplate Control Panel</li>
</ul>
<p>This one is a bit stupid. You first need the Magnifying Glass from the Photobomb structure. Once you do that, you can "let light pass through your magnifying glass" by tabbing out while keeping your magnifying glass facing the statue. Doing so, you get the following colors:</p>
Head: White (Very White)<br>
Torso, Left Arm, Right Arm: Piss Yellow (very yellow)<br>
Left Leg, Right Leg: Bright Green (Very Green)<br>
<p>Equipping these colors as your avatar, you unlock the Ultraviolet secret.</p>

<h2>Ultraviolent [#39]</h2>

<li>Personal Difficulty: 702</li>

<li>Unlocks: Paint Yourself!</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you obtained the Statue Identifier from Titan Attack, you can find out that you can load eyes on to the statue, which causes a weird behavior where it shoots laser to you. Simply die to the laser.</p>

<h2>Compound Nouns [#40]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 808</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 839</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Input the chemical formula of Trinitrotoluene on the laughing emoji."</li>
<li>Bullshit Meter: 7/10</li>
<li>Personal Opinion: are you fr</li>
<li>Unlocks: The Demon Core</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can see the list of things that the laughing emoji can point to, one of them is the chemical compound for Trinitrotoluene. TNT has a molecular formula of C7H5N3O6. You might find that, at first, clicking 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 doesn't work. This is because you have to click in order to reach that point, such as it will be similar to a clock showing 7PM, 5PM, 3PM, 6PM. You click 7 times to reach 7PM, then you click 10 times (7 + 10 = 17 - 12 = 5), then you click 10 times again (5 + 10 = 15 - 12 = 3), then you click it 3 times to reach 6PM.</p>

<li>Unlocks: Evil Arena</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the Evil Door unlocked from the "Secret" secret, you can kind of piece the clues together. You have a key in Elevator Traveling, and you have the locked door. You utilize the fact that you can drop tools from Floor 2, grab the key, and open the door.</p>

<h2>Compact Contour [#43]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 719</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 613</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Follow the instructions hidden in the microprofiler and complete the lights out puzzle."</li>
<li>Unlocks: Writer's Ruins</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the things that people should usually start checking is the microprofiler. You can access this by going to your roblox menu, go to settings, scroll all the way down to Micro Profiler, and switch it to on. You should see a lot of data at the top, but rest assured, most of these are for debugging purposes. What you want to do is to hover over the Mode, switch the Mode to Timer, go to the Script section, and you should see a human-readable text in here: </p>

![MicroProfiler Image](/images/secretuniverse/CompactContour.png)

<p>"Click every brick forming the outline of the 'spawn' structure ... face's mouth from top to bottom". From here, you can roughly guess what this is mentioning. At the spawn, there is a set of structures built in a way that it looks like a face. You can click on the outlines, top to bottom, left to right.</p>

![Face](/images/secretuniverse/CCFace.png)

<p>Once you do so, you are presented with a 5x5 lights out puzzle. You can simply do a google search on this if you're too lazy to decrypt it yourself</p>

<li>Unlocks: The Thinker</li>
</ul>
<p>As you continue to solve secrets and look for clues, you'll realize that one body part of yours is clickable, and it's inside your torso. Once you click it, you get some monologue about yourself. A bit entertaining to watch.</p>

Let's go back to the secret meetup that is uncopylocked from earlier. If you go to the v1 version, you'll assume that it's just a baseplate. However, a side-by-side comparison shows that there is a certain attribute that the v1 version has that isn't available to a normal baseplate!

![Huh? A string?](/images/secretuniverse/binarystring.png)

That's weird, there's a BinaryString here! Let's decode this from Base64!

"QL9-5-2-7-1-5-3-10"

And you know what QL can refer to? [QualityLevel](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/QualityLevel). Because of this, the answer requires you to set you graphics to 9, 5, 2, 7, 1, 5, 3, and 10 in that order.

<p>This puzzle is a bit silly. You'll realize that if you favorited all badges, you get to have ALL star pie pepperonis to be lit up. This is because each of them corresponded to a certain pepperoni. By doing elimination, you can figure out which badges light up which pepperoni, and from there, we can index the n-th number of the badge. For example, the badge 'so close' activates pepperoni with number '3', which means you take the third digit from the badge, 17[4]605653. You apply the same logic to get another badge at 423842212, which is the Egypt Exhibit badge.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you click on the Fuchsia ball from the BRB secret, you are prompted to save a model. In this model, you can find that the ball is a union. If you separate the union, you will find another ball placed far away with a few weird values that you won't find normally. This is in AssemblyLinearVelocity, where you find the following values: 42.21, 38.624, 380.426. Additionally, if you have tried messing around with the Fuchsia model itself ingame, you can find out that the baseplate that is under the Ball is clickable. We can interpret this as a grid of 25x25, and the values, separated by a dot or a space, are the coordinates in where we must click. The glowing sign is where our anchor should be.</p>
<p>From there, we obtain the following values: Row 2, Column 17<br>Row 1, Column 21<br>Row 2, Column 13<br>Row 25, Column 24<br>Row 16, Column 5<br>Row 18, Column 1.</p>

If you try to download the ball model straight through AssetDelivery, we can find out that strangely enough, the AssetDelivery for the Ball shows that it is on version 2, which means that there exists a version before. We can download the original asset through this [asset downloader](https://gev.neocities.org/rblxplacedl), or if you prefer a more direct link using the AssetDelivery API, [this link](https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset/?id=107512846420490&version=1). Once you open the V1 version of the model, you'll realize that a lot of the stuff are the same, except one thing: an ID. Yep, there is a different ID. This one goes under 84515480041362.
![Image of Asset](/images/secretuniverse/BruteBG.png)
That's strange, we can find [an asset](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/84515480041362/sqbkm) under this ID. The name of the model is "sqbkm", and in the description is another ID. I wonder what it can lead to?
![Tria OS?!](/images/secretuniverse/TriaWTF.png)
Tria.OS? That's a bit weird, but it will make more sense once you join. First of all, since Tria.OS doesn't allow you to load any random map, you must create an unverified server. Once you do so, you must load the map ID of "sqbkm". Once you do so, you can find that a map called "Secrets of the Universe" is loaded. 
As you join, you can see that the game gave you an instruction: 

Find 5 structures. 

You can locate the first one by falling off the map, <br>
The second one by throwing the ball off the map, <br>
The third one...is an among us to the left of where you spawn, by some patches of grass (you can click it and it will glow). <br>
The fourth one is an orb inside of your body. And yes, you must be fast. <br>

Once you do so, you can find a code written in the spawn of the map. Take note of it, insert it in the Answer Machine obtained from Fuchsia, and the machine shall blow up, giving you The Beginning.

<p>When you share a link to other people to get the 'Guest' secret, it makes sense for it to be attached to a launchdata. How do we find it? Well, let's try sending a link to another account, and let's press join after having the network tab open.</p>

<p>When you press join, the website makes a POST request to https://apis.roblox.com/sharelinks/v1/resolve-link. If you check the response, you will get this:</p>

```json
{"experienceInviteData":null,"friendInviteData":null,"notificationExperienceInviteData":{"status":"[Redacted]","inviterId":"[Redacted]","placeId":"[Redacted]","instanceId":null,"universeId":"[Redacted]","launchData":"pastel blue_concrete_bullseye_linked sword_reveal thyself, secret!"},"profileLinkResolutionResponseData":null,"screenshotInviteData":null,"privateServerInviteData":null,"experienceDetailsInviteData":null,"avatarItemDetailsData":null,"contentPostData":null,"experienceAffiliateData":null,"experienceEventData":null}

Sigh. Here we go.

The first step to solving this puzzle, like how other people have done it, is realizing that you actually have a strange orb in your inventory. Holding it out, the first thing you see is the fact that the portal color has changed. Weird. You investigate it, and it turns out...it brings you to a very weird location.

Here's where a lot of people seemed to stop try, but there's actually more! If you go to ~/Library/Logs/Roblox (on MacOS), you can find the fact that the game is sending you a warning. 

```
2025-09-12T21:12:22.471Z,6430.471191,6e1ef000,6 [FLog::Error] Error: Failed to load sound rbxasset://sounds/wordsy.wav: Temp read failed.
```

Hmm, weird, but where have I seen this before? Oh! Right! ~~ACBAS!~~ (Not really I didn't actually know it from ACBAS, and it was from my own research)

But anyways, the error is quite straightforward. The game is telling you that you seem to not have a file called wordsy.wav in your sounds file. Hmm, weird, so let's try adding a file called wordsy.wav inside that folder, and let's re-enter it!

![Corner is Open](/images/secretuniverse/CORNEROPEN.png)

When I first showed this discovery to my team, a lot of them thought I was exploiting, but nope, the prerequisite was just to have a file called wordsy.wav! That's quite fun, what's in it, you might ask?

...nothing of use. It seems that the audio is played in a way that it skips to different parts of the audio. Not sure that it means, so we dropped that for a bit...

...until one day, one of my teammates sent me this:

![Zero Hotbar](/images/secretuniverse/zerobar.png)

That's interesting! Turns out, if you hover over the zero hotbar with a wide enough monitor, you can find the strings 99430, WAY out of the screen. I wonder what it will lead to?

![Feodoric's Place](/images/secretuniverse/feoWHAT.png)

[Feodoric's Place](https://www.roblox.com/games/99430/Feodorics-Place)? That's interesting! I wonder what it has!

![oops](/images/secretuniverse/oops.png)

Uhm...Last updated 18 years ago... Surely this is a red herring?

WRONG!!! YOU'RE WRONG!!! YOU ARE WRONG!!! If you use Pwoofy's API Scanner™, with the universeID of Feodoric's place, which is 244803, you can find a localization data:

![Localization Data Found!](/images/secretuniverse/localizationdata.png)

There is a localization data on Feodoric's place, how interesting! This shows that despite the place being last updated 18 years ago, updating the localization data actually doesn't count as an update! I wonder what localization data the game has?

![namedesc](/images/secretuniverse/namedesc.png)

Hmm, interesting, so we have YQ_-UToUEXW. I wonder what this could be? Perhaps, a [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_-UToUEXW)?

Hm, no, that didn't work, maybe we're missing a step...

...and indeed we're missing a step! Did you know that you can search for the name of the strange orb? If you go to your SU inventory and type in b, you'll find that the strange orb is there, so the strange orb has the letter b in it, and as you go through every word, you'll slowly uncover the name of the orb. b...n...v... and so on, and this lead sto bnvigekey. I wonder if we can decrypt the youtube URL with that?

And indeed, you [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD_-ZLiQUTY)! That's wordsy.wav, so let's get to uploading that in our sounds folder and going back to the radio!

If you can hear the radio, it says "salmon ice, push portal, eye laser".

Huh, that's weird, let's try setting the baseplate to salmon, the material to ice, and get the eye laser to shoot the multiplayer portal!

\*boom sfx\*

Huh, something changed? 

If you enter the portal now, you can see that the other side of the room is now open!

![Open!](/images/secretuniverse/opensesame.png)

Interesting, I wonder what lies behind the do-

![Feodoric?](/images/secretuniverse/feoducky.png)

Feodoric? 

After some monologue, he disappears, telling us to be "worthy" first...

...fast forward a few days, identity fraud was discovered, so we entered the secret room again and...feodoric's dialogue changed?

If you assetdump feodoric's dialogue (like any sane person would do), you can find that the audio is dual-track, but only plays in one ear. From the audio, we can get the message "Click all void orbs with strange orb equipped". Seeing the material that the area in where feodoric is, we can roughly match it to the Quid Pro Quo's void path, and sure enough, there are orbs in that structure! 

If we click all of them, we'll get a notification saying "Void Orbs: Success". What next?

Well, since we found out that the door had a LOSS reference, similar to the one in the identity fraud structure, we just decided to keep gambling until...secret meetup? That's not supposed to be here?

Join the game, then meet feodoric. 

And thus, you have finally met the owner.

GGs.

 <p>Now, you decode the numbers on the aforementioned eye structure to reveal that it's...just numbers 1-8. Seems to be an input, but where do you input it?

Keep in mind that Historian was in V1, Identity was added in V2+, which means that the remaining structure is the Spawner, which is also in V2+. Just thought it was worth mentioning.</p>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right. Back to the puzzle. Let's analyze V2 of Secret Meetup. First thing you'd notice is that in StarterPack, there is an item called Spawner. You take the part out and put it in the workspace. Once you do so, you'll find out that it has...some really weird sizes!

```xml
<Vector3 name="size">
    <X>77.6800003</X>
    <Y>75.5599976</Y>
    <Z>0.290000916</Z>
</Vector3>
```

Ignoring floating point errors, we can take these numbers as 77.68, 75.56, and 0.29. What else is there that is not a default thing? Well, MaterialService has five materials: Inlet, Universal, Glue, Weld, and Studs. If you google this, they are the type of studs.

![Stud Types](/images/secretuniverse/studtypes.png)

Right. This is a good confirmer that we're doing StudReviewer. What else are we missing? The surface of the textures.

![Surfaces Yeah!](/images/secretuniverse/surfacesss.png)

Is that all? Maybe. But what do the sizes mean? Well, I found this on accident, so let me tell you how you're meant to solve it and put how I solved it in postproductions.

Basically, if you see each material, they all have an ID attached to their ColorMap/NormalMap. Let's take a look at the ID for Weld, for example.

```xml
<Item class="MaterialVariant" referent="RBXb43cf8abb43741f8b62c3116d0b500f5">
    <Properties>
				<BinaryString name="AttributesSerialize"></BinaryString>
				<token name="BaseMaterial">256</token>
				<SecurityCapabilities name="Capabilities">0</SecurityCapabilities>
				<Content name="ColorMap"><url>rbxassetid://10509843977</url></Content>
				<PhysicalProperties name="CustomPhysicalProperties">
					<CustomPhysics>false</CustomPhysics>
				</PhysicalProperties>
				<bool name="DefinesCapabilities">false</bool>
				<UniqueId name="HistoryId">00000000000000000000000000000000</UniqueId>
				<token name="MaterialPattern">0</token>
				<Content name="MetalnessMap"><null></null></Content>
				<string name="Name">Weld</string>
				<Content name="NormalMap"><url>rbxassetid://10509844001</url></Content>
				<Content name="RoughnessMap"><null></null></Content>
				<int64 name="SourceAssetId">-1</int64>
				<float name="StudsPerTile">2</float>
				<BinaryString name="Tags"></BinaryString>
				<Content name="TexturePack"><url>rbxassetid://135658353738004</url></Content>
				<UniqueId name="UniqueId">6beb806f9068c777082a462f000000f2</UniqueId>
    </Properties>
</Item>
```

Do you see the fact that it has a ColorMap? Right, now take a look at the last 2 digits of it. 77. Hmm, that's weird, I wonder what's also 77? Oh, the size. Surely this is a coincidence? Let's take a look at Universal!

```xml
<Item class="MaterialVariant" referent="RBXc185b25dfd5e48d09658ce440750513c">
    <Properties>
				<BinaryString name="AttributesSerialize"></BinaryString>

				<Content name="MetalnessMap"><null></null></Content>
				<string name="Name">Universal</string>
				<Content name="NormalMap"><url>rbxassetid://10509840812</url></Content>

				<int64 name="SourceAssetId">-1</int64>
				<float name="StudsPerTile">2</float>
				<BinaryString name="Tags"></BinaryString>
				<Content name="TexturePack"><url>rbxassetid://137811437796926</url></Content>
				<UniqueId name="UniqueId">6beb806f9068c777082a462f000000f1</UniqueId>
    </Properties>
</Item>
```

The ColorMap's 2 last digits is 68...And the second digit is 68, from 77.68.

Well, turns out, they sizes are the ColorMap of each of them, and ordering them gives you the following:
<br>
77 -> Weld<br>
68 -> Universal<br>
75 -> Inlet<br>
56 -> Glue<br>
0  -> Smooth<br>
29 -> Studs<br>
<br>

The reason why Smooth is 0 is because it does not have an ID. Now, what do we do with it? Well, we can use the Texture Surfaces to determine which part of them you needed to click.

<br>
Top face of Weld<br>
Bottom face of universal<br>
Right face of inlet<br>
Left face of glue<br>
Back face of smooth<br>
Front face of studs<br>
<br>

But how do we determine the orientation? Well, some things to note. If you see the Spawner, it has an upside down smile at the top of the handle part. You know what also has an upside down smile? The Spawn (as if Spawner wasn't that big of a hint already.)

![The Spawn](/images/secretuniverse/spawnstructure.png)

Additionally, we must follow the orientation based on the spawner. This means that Right and Left are inverted.

Right, so we have the order. What now? Well, right above, we have the order. Let's start with the top part of weld. We have to click the top part of weld, and any weld is a top part here, so let's do that.

![Weld](/images/secretuniverse/weld1.png)

Next, the bottom face of universal. The easiest way to do so is to click this surface.

![Universal](/images/secretuniverse/universal2.png)

Next, right face of inlet. Since the right side of the spawner turns out to be the left side:

![Inverted](/images/secretuniverse/spawner.png)

We need to click the left side.

![Inlet](/images/secretuniverse/inlet3.png)

Next, the left face of Glue. Similar to earlier, the left side of glue is the right.

![Glue](/images/secretuniverse/glue4.png)

Next, the back face of smooth. Remember since its inverted, we use the front part. The following that is highlighted is the back part of smooth.

![Spawner, Too!](/images/secretuniverse/asospawner.png)

That means, we need to click the front side of a smooth stud.

![Smooth](/images/secretuniverse/smooth.png)

And lastly, the front face of studs. In the spawner, this is the back. So let's click it.

![Studs](/images/secretuniverse/andlastlystuds.png)

And...YAY!!! GGG!!! You got it!

--------------------------------------------------------------POSTPRODUCTION NOTES--------------------------------------------------------------

Right. We found it on accident while trying to find the string of numbers. Ooops.

This one is a bit weird. First of all, you will have to go through and see the subplaces of the game. Let's see!

![Subplaces](/images/secretuniverse/SUSM.png)

Interesting, so Secret Meetup is a subplace of Secret Universe. But you can't access anything from it, it seems...Let's see if there's a different subplace?

![Secret...](/images/secretuniverse/isuniverse.png)

Seems like if you toggle isUniverseCreation in /v1/universes/{universeId}/places, you get a different result! And indeed, we can find a [subplace](https://www.roblox.com/games/98419386331120/Secret-Meetup#!/subplaces)! Hmm, nothing seems to be different...

![You can edit the place](/images/secretuniverse/youcanedit.png)

...huh? You can open the place in Roblox Studio? That's a bit weird, I wonder if there are previous versions of the game?

[v1](https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset?id=98419386331120&version=1)<br>
[v2](https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset?id=98419386331120&version=2)<br>
[v3](https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset?id=98419386331120&version=3)<br>
[v4](https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset?id=98419386331120&version=4)<br>

Turns out, there are four versions of the uncopylocked secret meetup? That's interesting. 

From here, I decided to export the version 1 and version 2 of the places as an rbxlx (an XML file, to make it easier for me to find differences in files). Then, under all the data, I found this:

![Interesting](/images/secretuniverse/Ifraud.png)

There's a difference in the CollisionGroups of the v1 and v2 of the place. I wonder what the second one decrypts to, as it has an extension!

![Decoded](/images/secretuniverse/b64dec.png)

Woah, we get an ID of 117789586701234? Let's see where that takes us!

![Hmm?](/images/secretuniverse/assetfound.png)

Oh, that seems like a valid [AssetID link](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/117789586701234), I wonder what it is?

![Weird...](/images/secretuniverse/weirdaf.png)

That's weird, we have this image of an avatar, and an ID, but it doesn't seem that this ID leads to a user? Or a place, or any other thing, I wonder what we need...

...I wonder if an Avatar ID exists? Let's go to Roblox's Avatar API.

<li>Unlocks: Endless Obby</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you start to run out of ideas for what a secret could be, you kinda have to try everything. In this case, if we use the Translation Feedback while the 'Secret Found!' text is on screen, you can see that it actually says the following:</p>
<p>Secret Found!Found! ￂﾭ   ￂﾭ ￂﾭ ￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭￂﾭￂﾭ ￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭￂﾭￂﾭ ￂﾭ ￂﾭ  ￂﾭ   ￂﾭￂﾭ ￂﾭ ￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭ   ￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭ ￂﾭￂﾭￂﾭ   ￂﾭ</p>
<p>That's a bit weird, but with Cipher reasoning skills, you can kinda deduct that it is binary. The space is a 0, and the character is a 1, and so, we get the following string:</p>
<p>010001010100111101001111010100100011010100110011001100010011010000110001</p>
<p>Decrypting this from Binary to Plaintext, we can get the string "EOOR53141"</p>
<p>EOOR is referring to the Easiest Obby On Roblox (AKA the Easy Obby), and 53141 means that you must hit the spawns in 5->3->1->4->1 order. Once you do so, you get the secret!</p>

Let's see where we can start. First of all, if you have played some amount of Minecraft (or if you reverse searched it), you can find that the structure in the I1MYWE is a loot chest. But what do we do with it? Well, let's try to find another clue. 

![Weird engraving on a torch](/images/secretuniverse/torchver.png)

That's weird, if we use the same cipher to decrypt this as the one in Pareidolia, we get a string of number. 1 21 7. If you know anything about Minecraft, you can come to the conclusion that this is a Minecraft Version, 1.21.7. So let's see what we have so far!
- A loot chest
- A minecraft version

What next? Well, there seems to be some difference between the chest in SU and the chest in Minecraft...

![Weird Glyph](/images/secretuniverse/glyphchest.png)

(Image credits to @stultar)

Ah! The difference is that we can decrypt this using the same cipher we used for earlier secrets!

Doing so, we get 124985146

Now, let's see what we have!

- A loot chest
- A minecraft version
- A seed

Hmm, I wonder if it's possible to generate a loot chest with a specific seed? 

Well, turns out, you can! And this is the command:

![Command](/images/secretuniverse/loottableseed.png)

And let's generate this in Minecraft...

![It's correct!](/images/secretuniverse/itfits.png)

(Image credits to @jj4mes)

Woah! That's similar to the things in our chest in I1MYWE! We can input the items in it, and then we can get the answer.

<h2>Access Granted [#97]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 700</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 700</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Uncover the vault below the Magic Elevator using the Baseplate Hole Punch and find the burled numbers to input the correct code."</li>
<li>Unlocks: Coin Counter</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's say you have gotten your hands on a Baseplate Hole Puncher. I wonder if there's a secret basement level to the elevator? Well, if you press the elevator to go up, head to the TAMS portal, you'll realize you're in a glitched state where the elevator is on Floor 1, but you're not. Knowing this, you can push the Hole Puncher on where the Elevator used to be, and you'll find a Vault! Once you uncovered the vault, you can see a glow scattered in the baseplate throughout the map. If you use the Hole Puncher again to get these numbers, you get the numbers 1, 3, 3, 7 as an item! That's funny, but you input them in those orders into the Vault. Cause. You know. 1337. Haha. Funny.</p>

<h2>Ultrafuchsia [#98]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 912</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 939 (890)</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Use the subspace tripmine at the 'Familiar Room' structure and solve the LaunchData puzzle."</li>

<li>🏆 Puzzle Award: Most BS puzzle 🏆</li>
<li>Unlocks: Answer Machine..?</li>
</ul>
Fuck. Where do I start. Head to the familiar room, and bore yourself to the point where you drop a subspace tripmine in the room, then, you will see this:

![Launch](/images/secretuniverse/launchfuchsia.png)

You'll see that on this side of the board, you can see the words "LAUNCH". This usually refers to Launchdata, so we'll keep that in mind. But what do we use as our LaunchData? Well, if you blow up the entire room, you'll find something weird: Some things aren't affected by the Subspace Tripmine's Color Change ability!

![Boom!](/images/secretuniverse/boom.png)

Hmm, that's a lot of the room, but I don't know the name of the room! What if it's the shirts? Or the shoes? Or the mirror? Or the lamp?

Well, let's get back to that later, but first of all, we need to identify the names of the things in this room. How do we get that? Well, if we reverse search the room, we can find the fact that the reason this is titled 'Familiar Room' is that it is actually the old roblox avatar editor changing room! I wonder if there's a publicly available documentation out there about this room?

And as it turns out, there [is](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/how-to-re-implement-the-old-avatar-editor/1920682)! Matter of fact, You can download this place [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/10573352129/Roblox-Old-Avatar-Customization)! Let's open this in Roblox Studio!

First of all, we need to Ungroup the entire thing, just so it's easier for us to select certain parts. Now, let's go back to some important stuff:

It's worth noting that meshes with textures actually do not change colors because of a tripmine! So we can cross those out.<br>
Additionally, we can also find the fact that reflective materials also do not change colors because of the tripmine, which leaves only one thing that doesn't change:

![The Orb](/images/secretuniverse/orbowo.png)

This light! But how do we find this name? Well, we already have it in our game, it is named Decoration-Orb, so that means we need to use Decoration-Orb as a launchdata, and boom! GG!

--------------------------------------------------------------POSTPRODUCTION NOTES--------------------------------------------------------------

I got pissed off when this was leaked. I was the first person outside of ggarg to solve this legitimately, just to have it leaked after. A bit unfortunate but whatever!

<li>Unlocks: Winpad</li>
</ul>
<p>This one is a bit fun, but conceptually a lot of people have tried this last update. The peculiar box mentioned comes from Half Measures, and it resembles the subspace tripmine. What you want to do is to figure out the location of the peculiar box in the original dimension (Dimension-3), which in this case is the gazebo obtained from The Beginning, place a tripmine there, then go back to dimension 6 to "detonate" the tripmine at that spot. Once you do so, you should get the secret!</p>

</ul>
<p>This is a try-things-out secret, but if you see the badge icon, one of the thoughts that you'd have is "it has to be related to the running track in dimension 3", in a way. This is true, and you actually have to get to the end of the boat trial (checkpoint 16), going back to dimension 3, touching the extra two checkpoints, going back to dimension 6, then finishing the race.</p>

<li>Official Solution: Transcribe the different MaxSpeeds of the Boat when doing the time trial and touch the checkpoints in order.</li>
<li>Unlocks: Peculiar Box</li>
</ul>
<p>This one is a bit stupid. When you drive around in the boat without starting the trials, you can see that the maximum speed to fill in the bar is 42.</p>

![MaxSpeed1](/images/secretuniverse/maxspeed.png)

<p>Once you start the race, however, the maximum speed to fill in the bar becomes 12. That's a bit weird, isn't it?</p>

![MaxSpeed2](/images/secretuniverse/maxspeed2.png)

<p>Going through the second checkpoint, the maximum speed to fill in the bar becomes 4.</p>

![MaxSpeed3](/images/secretuniverse/maxspeed3.png)

<p>Turns out, each gate changes the maximum speed to fill in the bar, in this following order:</p><br>
<p>12 4 8 10 9 2 7 13 11 16 14 2 5 3 6 15 1</p><br>
<p>If you drive through these checkpoints in order, you can get the secret!</p>

<p>This is somewhat of an extension to Chitty Chitty Bang, but you have to "get flung". Feodoric states that the intended solution to this is to fall from a great height while viewing a structure for some amount of time in freefall, but another method that works is to place tripmines in front of the ramp, getting on the ramp with speed coil, then with the ramp, you run to the tripmines. This should fling you.</p>

<h2>Game Over [#112]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 333</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 400</li>
<li>Official Solution: Launch the Snowball onto the walls of dimension 7, then wait until it becomes white and drop it into the void to access the Winter area.</li>
<li>Unlocks: Subspace Bubble</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally for me, this was a bit too hard of a secret (and it's also annoying). First of all, you need to have the Snowball structure from Artful Dodger. Additionally, this secret is also made WAY easier with Fortress Walls from Ground Zero, and I will showcase the tutorial with the Fortress Walls.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do this is to aim the snowball to the exit opposite to it.</p>

![Opposite](/images/secretuniverse/shitting.png)

<p>Then, subspace it such that it gets flung and stuck behind the walls. Push it to the balcony, wait for the snowball color to turn white, then push it off. Once you do so, jump into the void. You'll see that there is a snowball at the center of the other side. Touch it, let the credits roll, and you'll get the secret!</p>

<p>"How do you figure this out" you may ask, and the solution to that is...try things out yourself. Mostly from the fact that subspacing it to the void directly changes the environment you're in.</p>

<p>Let's start with something that we left off from the previous update. The sapling. If you try to play with it in this update, you'll see that there's one branch on the sapling (if you grow it enough) that is colored white. If you go to dimension-7, you'll see that the location of this white sapling is conveniently in the clouds. Clicking on it gives you a cloud item. You can use this to spawn balls that merge into a giant ball.</p>

<h2>Paraphernalia [#115]</h2>

<li>Personal Difficulty: 750</li>
<li>Official Solution: Solve the puzzle obtained from touching the Snowball with different tools and complete the specified task.</li>
<li>Unlocks: Tesla Coil</li>
</ul>
<p>Paraphernalia is a term to describe a group of equipment or tools. In SU, you can interpret this as having a few gears. Because this was update on the dimension-7 update, it is related to something there. One thing that has an interaction with gears is the snowball. For example, if you show the snowball a teddy bear, it will say "Can we be friends?". However, some gears have an interesting response attached to them.</p>

![Speed Coil](/images/secretuniverse/coilogy.png)

<p>For example, showing the snowball a speed coil prompts it to say 1-7. There are a handful of other things that has this interaction as well. Which are as follows:</p>
<p><br>
Regen: 2-2, 2-5, 3-6, 1-8<br>
Speed: 1-7<br>
Cloud: 1-1, 3-4<br>
Clover: 4-3<br>
</p>

<p>What does this mean? Well, this might sound like a stretch, but when you run out of things to try, you'll end up going through the tooltip of the items. Now, you may ask:</p>

![Speedcoil TT](/images/secretuniverse/coiltt.png)

<p>What tooltip? Looks normal...</p>
<br>
<p>I'm glad you asked! I wasn't talking about the tooltip IN secret universe, I'm talking about the tooltip of these items! Roblox rarely gives out tooltips to gears, and coincidentally, these four has a tooltip related to them! You can check this by going in another game and giving the gear to yourself (or in my case, I went to Catalog Avatar Creator and gave myself these items), and you can see the following:</p>
<br>
<p>April Showers (in SU, this is cloud):</p>

![April Shower](/images/secretuniverse/aprilshowers.png)

<p>Speed Coil:</p>

![Speed](/images/secretuniverse/seed.png)

<p>Regeneration Coil:</p>

![Regen](/images/secretuniverse/resk.png)

<p>Lucky Clover:</p>

![Clover](/images/secretuniverse/kena.png)

<p>Now that we have these, we can apply book cipher to these description!</p>

<br>

<p><br>
Cloud:  1-1 -> Bring<br>
Regen:  2-2 -> 4<br>
Clover: 4-3 -> lucky<br>
Cloud:  3-4 -> flowers<br>
Regen:  2-5 -> 4<br>
Regen:  3-6 -> the<br>
Speed:  1-7 -> speed<br>
Regen:  1-8 -> reskin<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>Bring 4 lucky flowers 4 the speed reskin. And tesla coil is the reskin, so this has got to be for paraphernalia! What you need to do from now is to get 4 lucky clovers (you can do this by dropping the clover, unequipping it from the inventory menu then equipping again, then picking up the dropped clover) and show it to the snowball! (dont forget to equip all 4 and interact with the snowball)</p>
