ALL SECRETS WILL FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>ExamplePuzzle</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: </li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: </li>

<li>Official Solution: </li>
<li>Unlocks: </li>
</ul>

<h2>Spawn Shark [#26]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 939</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 728</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Use TeleportToSpawnByName to spawn at a SpawnLocation called 'Shark'."</li>
<li>Personal Opinion: I only rated this as lower because I had already known about this method before.</li>
<li>Unlocks: Void Chair</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways one would start tackling this one. The most obvious is the title itself, "Spawn" "Shark". Considering the nature of Roblox Secret Games, we can roughly have the idea that this is something rather technical. Knowing this, if we go through the Roblox API github page and search up spawn, we can find a TeleportService method, which is TeleportToSpawnByName.</p>

```lua
local TPS = game:GetService("TeleportService")
script.Parent.Touched:Connect(function(Hit)
TPS:TeleportToSpawnByName(137630300324059, 'Shark', game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(Hit.Parent))
end)
```

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>Heartless [#27]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 355</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 105</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Throw the valentine into the void."</li>
<li>Unlocks: 💔 </li>
</ul>
<p>"Heartless" implies that you have to do something with the heart. If you have a subspace tripmine, you can easily blow up the valentines on accident, which means that this is much easier of a secret than its written!</p>
</div>

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>Superstar [#28]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 815</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 802</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Favorite Work at a Pizza Place's 'Cook' badge."</li>
<li>Bullshit Meter: 5/10 like what the fuck ok</li>
<li>Unlocks: Star Pie</li>
</ul>
This one was a bit tricky for me. I always had the idea of favoriting something (Superstar is a reference to star. You obtain star by favoriting the game), but I'm not sure what it was. However, seeing as the star was inside the Badger, I realized that it might have something to do with favoriting a badge. However, Roblox has removed the feature to favorite a badge.<br><br> So I tried to search for how to prompt a player to favorite something. Then eventually I stumbled across [this post](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/is-there-any-way-to-prompt-a-player-to-favorite-the-game/2717433). I realized that you can use AvatarEditorService:PromptSetFavorite to set a favorite, so I thought to myself: Why not try this with badges? So I came up with the following script:

```lua
local AvatarEditorService = game:GetService("AvatarEditorService")

local assetIds = {
	423842212,
	176686088,
	174605653,
	100158288,
	228602359,
	261773289,
	203066506,
	19391753,
	146093003,
	378631273,
}

for _, assetId in ipairs(assetIds) do
	print("Sending: " .. assetId)

	local success, result = pcall(function()
		game:GetService("AvatarEditorService"):PromptSetFavorite(assetId, Enum.AvatarItemType.Asset, true)
	end)

	if not success then
		warn("Failed: " .. assetId .. " | Error: " .. result)
	end

	task.wait(10) 
end

print("Finished prompting for all assets.")
```
<p>Now, you might have thought, why did I put so much asset IDs here? The answer to that is: I DONT KNOW!!! I DONT KNOW WHICH BADGE WORKED SO I PUT EVERYTHING IN! Eventually you unlock the solution and see that WAAPP's badge is needed. Not sure why, but cool.</p>

<h2>MY EYES!!!!!!!!! [#29]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 509</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 403 (10)</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Set the weather machine to maximum brightness."</li>
<li>Unlocks: Cool Sunglasses</li>
</ul>
<p>You can solve this by just fucking around with the weather machine you obtained from Task Master.</p>

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>Comeuppance [#30]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 825</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 750 (620)</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Get the eye to laser the laughing emoji."</li>
<li>Unlocks: A Game Of Secrets</li>
</ul>
<p>You all had it easy. Comeuppance used to have no badge icon, so I just thought that since comeuppance is a "deserved penalty", what in the map deserves a penalty from the eye? The laughing face. This just means that you should shoot the laughing emoji. However, since there is a badge now, you can just use your logic to shoot it.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>6 times 2 [#31]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 555</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 555</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Complete the Mr. Angry '#%!&' puzzle."</li>
<li>Unlocks: Trinitrotoluene</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have messed around with the Angry Emoji, you can realize you can click on it and it will turn. Through logical deduction, we can figure out that #%!& translates to 3517, because if you press Shift+3, you get #, and so on and so forth. You use the angry face as an input, but you interpret the angry face as a clock. To go from 12 to 3, you press 3 times. To go from 3 to 5, you press 2 times. To go from 5 to 1, you press 8 (5+8 = 13 - 12 = 1) times, and to go from 1 to 7, you press 6 times. Thus, the input code is 3286</p>

<li>Official Solution: "Survive the Demon Core's explosion."</li>
<li>Unlocks: Secrets Are Everywhere</li>
</ul>
<p>You can kind of realize that your goal is to survive when you first detonated the Demon Core that you get from solving Compound Nouns. You can realize that you can survive this after a certain height in the infinitower.</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 1000</li>

<li>Personal Difficulty: 200</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Hit a checkpoint in the easy obby while dead."</li>
<li>Unlocks: Indoor Obby</li>
</ul>
<p>You can figure out from the badge icon that you have to do something with resetting character (hence, post-mortem). The only place you can sort of die while hitting a finish line is by dying while hitting a checkpoint.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>Random Number Generation [#35]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 277</li>

<li>Official Solution: "Touch the Rainberge which spawns on the baseplate with a 1/1000 chance every second"</li>
<li>Unlocks: Super Secret Checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>The server will randomly send a message saying the Rainberge has spawned. You just have to find it in the map.</p>

<h2>Sharpshooter [#36]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 401</li>

<li>Official Solution: "Walk the plank on floor 10 of the Infinitower and hit a bullseye on the 'Target' Structure"</li>
<li>Unlocks: Running Track</li>
</ul>
<p>This is something you kinda have to try out for yourself. You'll figure out logically that you can drop to the bullseye from any height.</p>
</div>

<div class="puzzle-entry" markdown="1">
<h2>Hackerman [#37]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 60</li>

<li>Personal Opinion: No way this shit is a 60 wtf</li>
<li>Unlocks: RandomMoneyMaker 9000™</li>

<h2>Ultraviolet [#38]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 789</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 840</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Equip body colors visible on the statue through the magnifying glass while the game window is unfocused."</li>
<li>Bullshit Meter: 7/10</li>
<li>Personal Opinion: BULLSHIT</li>
<li>Unlocks: Baseplate Control Panel</li>
</ul>
<p>This one is a bit stupid. You first need the Magnifying Glass from the Photobomb structure. Once you do that, you can "let light pass through your magnifying glass" by tabbing out while keeping your magnifying glass facing the statue. Doing so, you get the following colors:</p>
Head: White (Very White)<br>
Torso, Left Arm, Right Arm: Piss Yellow (very yellow)<br>
Left Leg, Right Leg: Bright Green (Very Green)<br>
<p>Equipping these colors as your avatar, you unlock the Ultraviolet secret.</p>

<h2>Ultraviolent [#39]</h2>

<li>Unlocks: Paint Yourself!</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you obtained the Statue Identifier from Titan Attack, you can find out that you can load eyes on to the statue, which causes a weird behavior where it shoots laser to you. Simply die to the laser.</p>

<h2>Compound Nouns [#40]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 808</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 839</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Input the chemical formula of Trinitrotoluene on the laughing emoji."</li>
<li>Bullshit Meter: 7/10</li>
<li>Personal Opinion: are you fr</li>
<li>Unlocks: The Demon Core</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can see the list of things that the laughing emoji can point to, one of them is the chemical compound for Trinitrotoluene. TNT has a molecular formula of C7H5N3O6. You might find that, at first, clicking 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 doesn't work. This is because you have to click in order to reach that point, such as it will be similar to a clock showing 7PM, 5PM, 3PM, 6PM. You click 7 times to reach 7PM, then you click 10 times (7 + 10 = 17 - 12 = 5), then you click 10 times again (5 + 10 = 15 - 12 = 3), then you click it 3 times to reach 6PM.</p>

<h2>Compact Contour [#43]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 719</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 613</li>
<li>Official Solution: "Follow the instructions hidden in the microprofiler and complete the lights out puzzle."</li>
<li>Unlocks: Writer's Ruins</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the things that people should usually start checking is the microprofiler. You can access this by going to your roblox menu, go to settings, scroll all the way down to Micro Profiler, and switch it to on. You should see a lot of data at the top, but rest assured, most of these are for debugging purposes. What you want to do is to hover over the Mode, switch the Mode to Timer, go to the Script section, and you should see a human-readable text in here: </p>

![MicroProfiler Image](/images/secretuniverse/compact.png)

<p>"Click every brick forming the outline of the 'spawn' structure ... face's mouth from top to bottom". From here, you can roughly guess what this is mentioning. At the spawn, there is a set of structures built in a way that it looks like a face. You can click on the outlines, top to bottom, left to right.</p>

![Face](/images/secretuniverse/CCFace.png)

<p>The following is the order for Compact Contour:</p>

![Compact Contour Order](/images/secretuniverse/compactcontour.png)

<p>Once you do so, you are presented with a 5x5 lights out puzzle. You can simply do a google search on this if you're too lazy to decrypt it yourself</p>

<p>As you continue to solve secrets and look for clues, you'll realize that one body part of yours is clickable, and it's inside your torso. Once you click it, you get some monologue about yourself. A bit entertaining to watch.</p>

Let's go back to the secret meetup that is uncopylocked from earlier. If you go to the v1 version, you'll assume that it's just a baseplate. However, a side-by-side comparison shows that there is a certain attribute that the v1 version has that isn't available to a normal baseplate!

![Huh? A string?](/images/secretuniverse/binarystring.png)

That's weird, there's a BinaryString here! Let's decode this from Base64!

"QL9-5-2-7-1-5-3-10"

And you know what QL can refer to? [QualityLevel](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/QualityLevel). Because of this, the answer requires you to set you graphics to 9, 5, 2, 7, 1, 5, 3, and 10 in that order.

<p>This puzzle is a bit silly. You'll realize that if you favorited all badges, you get to have ALL star pie pepperonis to be lit up. This is because each of them corresponded to a certain pepperoni. By doing elimination, you can figure out which badges light up which pepperoni, and from there, we can index the n-th number of the badge. For example, the badge 'so close' activates pepperoni with number '3', which means you take the third digit from the badge, 17[4]605653. You apply the same logic to get another badge at 423842212, which is the Egypt Exhibit badge.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you click on the Fuchsia ball from the BRB secret, you are prompted to save a model. In this model, you can find that the ball is a union. If you separate the union, you will find another ball placed far away with a few weird values that you won't find normally. This is in AssemblyLinearVelocity, where you find the following values: 42.21, 38.624, 380.426. Additionally, if you have tried messing around with the Fuchsia model itself ingame, you can find out that the baseplate that is under the Ball is clickable. We can interpret this as a grid of 25x25, and the values, separated by a dot or a space, are the coordinates in where we must click. In other words, the top left of the fuchsia ball's base (including the slanted part) is considered "1", and the bottom right of the base is "625". The glowing sign is where our anchor should be. Based on our values, we click on the 42th stud, 21st stud, and so on. We can translate this to coordinates in the fuchsia ball's base.</p>
<p>We obtain the following values: <br>Row 2, Column 17<br>Row 1, Column 21<br>Row 2, Column 13<br>Row 25, Column 24<br>Row 16, Column 5<br>Row 18, Column 1.</p>
<p>Now, we can map this to the Fuchsia grid as follows:</p>

If you try to download the ball model straight through AssetDelivery, we can find out that strangely enough, the AssetDelivery for the Ball shows that it is on version 2, which means that there exists a version before. We can download the original asset through this [asset downloader](https://gev.neocities.org/rblxplacedl), or if you prefer a more direct link using the AssetDelivery API, [this link](https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset/?id=107512846420490&version=1). Once you open the V1 version of the model, you'll realize that a lot of the stuff are the same, except one thing: an ID. Yep, there is a different ID. This one goes under 84515480041362.
![Image of Asset](/images/secretuniverse/BruteBG.png)
That's strange, we can find [an asset](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/84515480041362/sqbkm) under this ID. The name of the model is "sqbkm", and in the description is another ID. I wonder what it can lead to?
![Tria OS?!](/images/secretuniverse/TriaWTF.png)
Tria.OS? That's a bit weird, but it will make more sense once you join. First of all, since Tria.OS doesn't allow you to load any random map, you must create an unverified server. Once you do so, you must load the map ID of "sqbkm". Once you do so, you can find that a map called "Secrets of the Universe" is loaded. 
As you join, you can see that the game gave you an instruction: 

Find 5 structures. 

You can locate the first one by falling off the map, <br>
The second one by throwing the ball off the map, <br>
The third one...is an among us to the left of where you spawn, by some patches of grass (you can click it and it will glow). <br>
The fourth one is an orb inside of your body. And yes, you must be fast. <br>

Once you do so, you can find a code written in the spawn of the map. Take note of it, insert it in the Answer Machine obtained from Fuchsia, and the machine shall blow up, giving you The Beginning.

<p>When you share a link to other people to get the 'Guest' secret, it makes sense for it to be attached to a launchdata. How do we find it? Well, let's try sending a link to another account, and let's press join after having the network tab open.</p>

<p>When you press join, the website makes a POST request to https://apis.roblox.com/sharelinks/v1/resolve-link. If you check the response, you will get this:</p>

```json

</ul>
<p>Let's start with one of the most obvious fumbles of the decade by the entirety of the SU community. If you've read about Double Jeopardy (which is later on in this document), you'll know about the translation feedback feature (if not, you can go skip to that point to learn more about it). If you've messed around a bit, you'll realize that you can actually run translation feedback on a coin, which leads to the following error:</p>

```
2025-12-15T06:52:10.754Z,221.754929,78c27000,6 [FLog::Error] Asset (Image) "https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset?id=75915989476590" load failed in CoreGui.Children.ScreenFrame.FeedbackReportDialog.Dialog.Content.Contents.MainCanvas.MainCanvas.SelectedTextLabel.Image: Asset type does not match requested type
```

That's a bit weird. If you insert the ID, you'll realize that it leads to the [coin model](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/75915989476590/RenderMesh). We can load this ID into roblox studio as a MeshPart, and take a look at it!

![Coin Image](/images/secretuniverse/coint.png)

<p>Do you see it? No? Well, let's turn on wireframe rendering just to be sure that there's nothing. Surely there's nothing, right?</p>

![Coin Image](/images/secretuniverse/coinxray.png)

<p>Do you see it? There's something weird. A small square on the left side of the coin.</p>

![Coin Image](/images/secretuniverse/glump.png)

<p>It seems to be a QR code. You can do this by applying a ColorMap in the SurfaceAppearance of the MeshPart. Scanning it reveals the following text:</p>

<p>COGNITOHAZARD Atop the tree of death, summon the subject.</p>

<p>Good, so we know this is for Cognitohazard. Additionally, we also know that the tree of death refers to the tree that you get from Danse Macabre. So let's stand there.</p>

But what is the subject? Well, let's check out what we have for Swinburne, the prize of this puzzle. Doing a google search, we can find that it was part of an old Roblox [ARG](https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Player:Swinburne). Swinburne has a [place](https://www.roblox.com/games/108485/HERE-where-the-world-is-quiet) tied to the ARG. Since the place is uncopylocked, we can see in it. Inside of the place, we can find a Smooth Block Model with a script named "One". Why do we choose that? Because it has the following script:

![Solve](/images/secretuniverse/onescript.png)

<p>The subject should be ALGERNON. Interesting. Perhaps we can try sending a trade request (similar in concept to "summoning") to Algernon?</p>

<p>Indeed, Algernon spawns. And you get Cognitohazard. (Previously, you had to also say "Atop the tree of death, summon the subject." after spawning him.)</p>

Sigh. Here we go.

The first step to solving this puzzle, like how other people have done it, is realizing that you actually have a strange orb in your inventory. Holding it out, the first thing you see is the fact that the portal color has changed. Weird. You investigate it, and it turns out...it brings you to a very weird location.

Here's where a lot of people seemed to stop try, but there's actually more! If you go to ~/Library/Logs/Roblox (on MacOS), you can find the fact that the game is sending you a warning. 

```
2025-09-12T21:12:22.471Z,6430.471191,6e1ef000,6 [FLog::Error] Error: Failed to load sound rbxasset://sounds/wordsy.wav: Temp read failed.
```

Hmm, weird, but where have I seen this before? Oh! Right! ~~ACBAS!~~ (Not really I didn't actually know it from ACBAS, and it was from my own research)

But anyways, the error is quite straightforward. The game is telling you that you seem to not have a file called wordsy.wav in your sounds file. Hmm, weird, so let's try adding a file called wordsy.wav inside that folder, and let's re-enter it!

![Corner is Open](/images/secretuniverse/CORNEROPEN.png)

When I first showed this discovery to my team, a lot of them thought I was exploiting, but nope, the prerequisite was just to have a file called wordsy.wav! That's quite fun, what's in it, you might ask?

...nothing of use. It seems that the audio is played in a way that it skips to different parts of the audio. Not sure that it means, so we dropped that for a bit...

...until one day, one of my teammates sent me this:

![Zero Hotbar](/images/secretuniverse/zerobar.png)

That's interesting! Turns out, if you hover over the zero hotbar with a wide enough monitor, you can find the strings 99430, WAY out of the screen. I wonder what it will lead to?

![Feodoric's Place](/images/secretuniverse/feoWHAT.png)

[Feodoric's Place](https://www.roblox.com/games/99430/Feodorics-Place)? That's interesting! I wonder what it has!

![oops](/images/secretuniverse/oops.png)

Uhm...Last updated 18 years ago... Surely this is a red herring?

WRONG!!! YOU'RE WRONG!!! YOU ARE WRONG!!! If you use Pwoofy's API Scanner™, with the universeID of Feodoric's place, which is 244803, you can find a localization data:

![Localization Data Found!](/images/secretuniverse/localizationdata.png)

There is a localization data on Feodoric's place, how interesting! This shows that despite the place being last updated 18 years ago, updating the localization data actually doesn't count as an update! I wonder what localization data the game has?

![namedesc](/images/secretuniverse/namedesc.png)

Hmm, interesting, so we have YQ_-UToUEXW. I wonder what this could be? Perhaps, a [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_-UToUEXW)?

Hm, no, that didn't work, maybe we're missing a step...

...and indeed we're missing a step! Did you know that you can search for the name of the strange orb? If you go to your SU inventory and type in b, you'll find that the strange orb is there, so the strange orb has the letter b in it, and as you go through every word, you'll slowly uncover the name of the orb. b...n...v... and so on, and this leads to bnvigekey. I wonder if we can decrypt the youtube URL with that?

And indeed, you [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD_-ZLiQUTY)! That's wordsy.wav, so let's get to uploading that in our sounds folder and going back to the radio!

If you can hear the radio, it says "salmon ice, push portal, eye laser".

Huh, that's weird, let's try setting the baseplate to salmon, the material to ice, and get the eye laser to shoot the multiplayer portal!

\*boom sfx\*

Huh, something changed? 

If you enter the portal now, you can see that the other side of the room is now open!

![Open!](/images/secretuniverse/opensesame.png)

Interesting, I wonder what lies behind the do-

![Feodoric?](/images/secretuniverse/feoducky.png)

Feodoric? 

After some monologue, he disappears, telling us to be "worthy" first...

...fast forward a few days, identity fraud was discovered, so we entered the secret room again and...feodoric's dialogue changed?

If you assetdump feodoric's dialogue (like any sane person would do), you can find that the audio is dual-track, but only plays in one ear (You can extract this directly from Roblox's Caches).

![morse](/images/secretuniverse/morse2.png)

If we run it through a spectrogram, you can see that on the bottom track (in this case, right track), we can see some morse code. From the audio, we can get the message "CLICKALLVOIDORBSWITHSTRANGEORBEQUIPPED". Hmm. Click all void orbs with strange orb equipped? Well, the closest thing to a void orb is the spheres in the Quid Pro Quo's void path. So we click these orbs with the strange orb equipped.

If we click all of them, we'll get a notification saying "Void Orbs: Success". What next?

Well, since we found out that the door had a LOSS reference, similar to the one in the identity fraud structure, we just decided to keep gambling until...secret meetup? That's not supposed to be here?

Join the game, then meet feodoric. 

And thus, you have finally met the owner.

GGs.

</ul>
<p>At the spawn of Secret Universe, you can find some structures that resemble the eye on the top side of the spawn (near the entrance to the central shop). The outline of these eyes have certain numbers engraved to it. How do you know it's numbers? Well, if you enter Secret Meetup, you'll find a glyph above the portal. If you try to work your way to figure out what these numbers are, you'll realize that the numbers are Secret Universe's ID. You can somewhat create your own substitution cipher as below:</p>

![Pareidolia Glyph](/images/secretuniverse/pareidoliaglyph.png)

 <p>Now, you decode the numbers on the aforementioned eye structure to reveal that it's...just numbers 1-8. Seems to be an input, but where do you input it? Well, if you've explored the game a bit, you'll realize that the seats in secret meetup are similar in color to the color of the studs on the outline of the eye. You can use that as the input.</p>

<p>Fuck this puzzle. I had to rejoin to input my codes because my shit bugged out.</p>

--------------------------------------------------------------PREPRODUCTION NOTES--------------------------------------------------------------

<p>If you've seen Feodoric's Video, you'll realize a few things, one of them that is the most important is the fact that Historian, StudReviewer, and Identity Fraud was added on the same batch. Since Historian and Identity Fraud were related to the Uncopylocked Secret Meetup, that means StudReviewer should be in SM too. Keep in mind that Historian was in V1, Identity was added in V2+, which means that the remaining structure is the Spawner, which is also in V2+. Just thought it was worth mentioning.</p>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right. Back to the puzzle. Let's analyze V2 of Secret Meetup. First thing you'd notice is that in StarterPack, there is an item called Spawner. You take the part out and put it in the workspace. Once you do so, you'll find out that it has...some really weird sizes!

```xml
<Vector3 name="size">
    <X>77.6800003</X>
    <Y>75.5599976</Y>
    <Z>0.290000916</Z>
</Vector3>
```

Ignoring floating point errors, we can take these numbers as 77.68, 75.56, and 0.29. What else is there that is not a default thing? Well, MaterialService has five materials: Inlet, Universal, Glue, Weld, and Studs. If you google this, they are the type of studs.

![Stud Types](/images/secretuniverse/studtypes.png)

Right. This is a good confirmer that we're doing StudReviewer. What else are we missing? The surface of the textures.

![Surfaces Yeah!](/images/secretuniverse/surfacesss.png)

Is that all? Maybe. But what do the sizes mean? Well, I found this on accident, so let me tell you how you're meant to solve it and put how I solved it in postproductions.

Basically, if you see each material, they all have an ID attached to their ColorMap/NormalMap. Let's take a look at the ID for Weld, for example.

```xml
<Item class="MaterialVariant" referent="RBXb43cf8abb43741f8b62c3116d0b500f5">
    <Properties>
				<BinaryString name="AttributesSerialize"></BinaryString>
				<token name="BaseMaterial">256</token>
				<SecurityCapabilities name="Capabilities">0</SecurityCapabilities>
				<Content name="ColorMap"><url>rbxassetid://10509843977</url></Content>
				<PhysicalProperties name="CustomPhysicalProperties">
					<CustomPhysics>false</CustomPhysics>
				</PhysicalProperties>
				<bool name="DefinesCapabilities">false</bool>
				<UniqueId name="HistoryId">00000000000000000000000000000000</UniqueId>
				<token name="MaterialPattern">0</token>
				<Content name="MetalnessMap"><null></null></Content>
				<string name="Name">Weld</string>
				<Content name="NormalMap"><url>rbxassetid://10509844001</url></Content>
				<Content name="RoughnessMap"><null></null></Content>
				<int64 name="SourceAssetId">-1</int64>
				<float name="StudsPerTile">2</float>
				<BinaryString name="Tags"></BinaryString>
				<Content name="TexturePack"><url>rbxassetid://135658353738004</url></Content>
				<UniqueId name="UniqueId">6beb806f9068c777082a462f000000f2</UniqueId>
    </Properties>
</Item>
```

Do you see the fact that it has a ColorMap? Right, now take a look at the last 2 digits of it. 77. Hmm, that's weird, I wonder what's also 77? Oh, the size. Surely this is a coincidence? Let's take a look at Universal!

```xml
<Item class="MaterialVariant" referent="RBXc185b25dfd5e48d09658ce440750513c">
    <Properties>
				<BinaryString name="AttributesSerialize"></BinaryString>

    </Properties>
</Item>
```

The ColorMap's 2 last digits is 68...And the second digit is 68, from 77.68.

Well, turns out, they sizes are the ColorMap of each of them, and ordering them gives you the following:
<br>
77 -> Weld<br>
68 -> Universal<br>
75 -> Inlet<br>
56 -> Glue<br>
0  -> Smooth<br>
29 -> Studs<br>
<br>

The reason why Smooth is 0 is because it does not have an ID. Now, what do we do with it? Well, we can use the Texture Surfaces to determine which part of them you needed to click.

<br>
Top face of Weld<br>
Bottom face of universal<br>
Right face of inlet<br>
Left face of glue<br>
Back face of smooth<br>
Front face of studs<br>
<br>

But how do we determine the orientation? Well, some things to note. If you see the Spawner, it has an upside down smile at the top of the handle part. You know what also has an upside down smile? The Spawn (as if Spawner wasn't that big of a hint already.)

![The Spawn](/images/secretuniverse/spawnstructure.png)

Additionally, we must follow the orientation based on the spawner. This means that Right and Left are inverted.

Right, so we have the order. What now? Well, right above, we have the order. Let's start with the top part of weld. We have to click the top part of weld, and any weld is a top part here, so let's do that.

![Weld](/images/secretuniverse/weld1.png)

Next, the bottom face of universal. The easiest way to do so is to click this surface.

![Universal](/images/secretuniverse/universal2.png)

Next, right face of inlet. Since the right side of the spawner turns out to be the left side:

![Inverted](/images/secretuniverse/spawner.png)

We need to click the left side.

![Inlet](/images/secretuniverse/inlet3.png)

Next, the left face of Glue. Similar to earlier, the left side of glue is the right.

![Glue](/images/secretuniverse/glue4.png)

Next, the back face of smooth. Remember since its inverted, we use the front part. The following that is highlighted is the back part of smooth.

![Spawner, Too!](/images/secretuniverse/asospawner.png)

That means, we need to click the front side of a smooth stud.

![Smooth](/images/secretuniverse/smooth.png)

And lastly, the front face of studs. In the spawner, this is the back. So let's click it.

![Studs](/images/secretuniverse/andlastlystuds.png)

And...YAY!!! GGG!!! You got it!

> POSTPRODUCTION NOTES

Right. We found it on accident while trying to find the string of numbers. Ooops.

This one is a bit weird. First of all, you will have to go through and see the subplaces of the game. Let's see!

![Subplaces](/images/secretuniverse/SUSM.png)

Interesting, so Secret Meetup is a subplace of Secret Universe. But you can't access anything from it, it seems...Let's see if there's a different subplace?

![Secret...](/images/secretuniverse/isuniverse.png)

Seems like if you toggle isUniverseCreation in /v1/universes/{universeId}/places, you get a different result! And indeed, we can find a [subplace](https://www.roblox.com/games/98419386331120/Secret-Meetup#!/subplaces)! Hmm, nothing seems to be different...

![You can edit the place](/images/secretuniverse/youcanedit.png)

...huh? You can open the place in Roblox Studio? That's a bit weird, I wonder if there are previous versions of the game?

[v1](https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset?id=98419386331120&version=1)<br>
[v2](https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset?id=98419386331120&version=2)<br>
[v3](https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset?id=98419386331120&version=3)<br>
[v4](https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset?id=98419386331120&version=4)<br>

Turns out, there are four versions of the uncopylocked secret meetup? That's interesting. 

From here, I decided to export the version 1 and version 2 of the places as an rbxlx (an XML file, to make it easier for me to find differences in files). Then, under all the data, I found this:

![Interesting](/images/secretuniverse/Ifraud.png)

There's a difference in the CollisionGroups of the v1 and v2 of the place. I wonder what the second one decrypts to, as it has an extension!

![Decoded](/images/secretuniverse/b64dec.png)

Woah, we get an ID of 117789586701234? Let's see where that takes us!

![Hmm?](/images/secretuniverse/assetfound.png)

Oh, that seems like a valid [AssetID link](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/117789586701234), I wonder what it is?

![Weird...](/images/secretuniverse/weirdaf.png)

That's weird, we have this image of an avatar, and an ID, but it doesn't seem that this ID leads to a user? Or a place, or any other thing, I wonder what we need...

...I wonder if an Avatar ID exists? Let's go to Roblox's Avatar API.

![OutfitID?](/images/secretuniverse/outfitid.png)

UserOutfitID? Let's try to plug that in, and...

<li>Unlocks: Endless Obby</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you start to run out of ideas for what a secret could be, you kinda have to try everything. In this case, if we use the Translation Feedback while the 'Secret Found!' text is on screen, you can see that it actually says the following:</p>
<p>Secret Found!Found! ￂﾭ   ￂﾭ ￂﾭ ￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭￂﾭￂﾭ ￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭￂﾭￂﾭ ￂﾭ ￂﾭ  ￂﾭ   ￂﾭￂﾭ ￂﾭ ￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭ   ￂﾭ  ￂﾭￂﾭ ￂﾭￂﾭￂﾭ   ￂﾭ</p>
<p>That's a bit weird, but with Cipher reasoning skills, you can kinda deduct that it is binary. The space is a 0, and the character is a 1, and so, we get the following string:</p>
<p>010001010100111101001111010100100011010100110011001100010011010000110001</p>
<p>Decrypting this from Binary to Plaintext, we can get the string "EOOR53141"</p>
<p>EOOR is referring to the Easiest Obby On Roblox (AKA the Easy Obby), and 53141 means that you must hit the spawns in 5->3->1->4->1 order. Once you do so, you get the secret!</p>

Let's see where we can start. First of all, if you have played some amount of Minecraft (or if you reverse searched it), you can find that the structure in the I1MYWE is a loot chest. But what do we do with it? Well, let's try to find another clue. 

![Weird engraving on a torch](/images/secretuniverse/torchver.png)

That's weird, if we use the same cipher to decrypt this as the one in Pareidolia, we get a string of number. 1 21 7. If you know anything about Minecraft, you can come to the conclusion that this is a Minecraft Version, 1.21.7. So let's see what we have so far!
- A loot chest
- A minecraft version

What next? Well, there seems to be some difference between the chest in SU and the chest in Minecraft...

![Weird Glyph](/images/secretuniverse/glyphchest.png)

(Image credits to @stultar)

Ah! The difference is that we can decrypt this using the same cipher we used for earlier secrets!

Doing so, we get 124985146

Now, let's see what we have!

- A loot chest
- A minecraft version
- A seed

Hmm, I wonder if it's possible to generate a loot chest with a specific seed? 

Well, turns out, you can! And this is the command:

![Command](/images/secretuniverse/loottableseed.png)

And let's generate this in Minecraft...

![It's correct!](/images/secretuniverse/itfits.png)

(Image credits to @jj4mes)

Woah! That's similar to the things in our chest in I1MYWE! We can input the items in it, and then we can get the answer.

If you don't, then utilize the Ardy's Ship structure, bring it to the left of the arena, and slowly push your baseplate hole puncher over it until you can push it and drop it to the baseplate.

Knowing this, you can push the Hole Puncher on where the Elevator used to be, and you'll find a Vault! Once you uncovered the vault, you can see a glow scattered in the baseplate throughout the map. If you use the Hole Puncher again to get these numbers, you get the numbers 1, 3, 3, 7 as an item! That's funny, but you input them in those orders into the Vault. Cause. You know. 1337. Haha.

<h2>Ultrafuchsia [#98]</h2>

<li>Bullshit Meter: 9/10</li>
<li>🏆 Puzzle Award: Most BS puzzle 🏆</li>
<li>Unlocks: Answer Machine..?</li>
</ul>
Fuck. Where do I start. Head to the familiar room, and bore yourself to the point where you drop a subspace tripmine in the room, then, you will see this:

![Launch](/images/secretuniverse/launchfuchsia.png)

You'll see that on this side of the board, you can see the words "LAUNCH". This usually refers to Launchdata, so we'll keep that in mind. But what do we use as our LaunchData? Well, if you blow up the entire room, you'll find something weird: Some things aren't affected by the Subspace Tripmine's Color Change ability!

![Boom!](/images/secretuniverse/boom.png)

Hmm, that's a lot of the room, but I don't know the name of the room! What if it's the shirts? Or the shoes? Or the mirror? Or the lamp?

Well, let's get back to that later, but first of all, we need to identify the names of the things in this room. How do we get that? Well, if we reverse search the room, we can find the fact that the reason this is titled 'Familiar Room' is that it is actually the old roblox avatar editor changing room! I wonder if there's a publicly available documentation out there about this room?

And as it turns out, there [is](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/how-to-re-implement-the-old-avatar-editor/1920682)! Matter of fact, You can download this place [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/10573352129/Roblox-Old-Avatar-Customization)! Let's open this in Roblox Studio!

First of all, we need to Ungroup the entire thing, just so it's easier for us to select certain parts. Now, let's go back to some important stuff:

It's worth noting that meshes with textures actually do not change colors because of a tripmine! So we can cross those out.<br>
Additionally, we can also find the fact that reflective materials also do not change colors because of the tripmine, which leaves only one thing that doesn't change:

![The Orb](/images/secretuniverse/orbowo.png)

This light! But how do we find this name? Well, we already have it in our game, it is named Decoration-Orb, so that means we need to use Decoration-Orb as a launchdata, and boom! GG!

> POSTPRODUCTION NOTES

I got pissed off when this was leaked. I was the first person outside of ggarg to solve this legitimately, just to have it leaked after. A bit unfortunate but whatever!

<h2>Double Jeopardy [#99]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: 992</li>
<li>Personal Difficulty: 940</li>
<li>Personal Opinion: man...i thought this would be much cooler but its ok</li>
<li>Official Solution: Utilize Translation Feedback and Vigenere Cipher in various ways and solve the puzzle.</li>
<li>Unlocks: Construction Yard</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start with the concept of translation feedback. You can get any text, or any decal (the list goes further, but these are the two main ways people use it) by going to settings and pressing on "give feedback". If you try this around, you'll see that whenever you have a teleport prompt showing up, it will show "???" instead of the teleport prompt. That's very weird, isn't it? Well, if you click on the question marks, you'll get "TRANSLATIONKEYBACK". Do keep this in mind as well.</p>
<br>
<p>Next thing is that translation feedback can also change your environment. For example, if you go to the puthing around structure, you'll see that the teleport is to "Endless Secrets". However, if you turn translation feedback on, you'll see that it changes to "obby but my viewers made it" by robey100, with the description of "l_______________m".</p> 

Indeed, if you go to the game, you'll encounter a stage where there are a list of people's names. If you go through it one by one, you'll find a user named liminalminimalism. If you search for this guy, you'll see that he no longer exists. However, we can always scrape some data about him, such as his socials, which is one of the main things that people would search for. We can do this using the API for promotion channels of a user, which is [here](https://accountinformation.roblox.com/v1/users/7176979085/promotion-channels?alwaysReturnUrls=true&filterLink=true).

<p>Using that, we get GG_KRQ_YIEXOEDC. If you decrypt this with TRANSLATIONKEYBACK as the key, you get NP_KEY_NILPARTY. This means that your next step involves NP, which is Nil Portal. You can head to the nil portal and attempt to translation feedback again, and you will get FBLGTVKNYINT VZZCIWTPKALBSNUPSUDCL. If you decrypt this with NILPARTY as the key, you get "STARTERPLACE VIGEVOIAKJSDFFJASDKEY". This implies that our next step is in Starter Place, which is obtained from UTV. If you head to that dimension, you can go to the concrete plate in the center. If you run translation feedback, you might not find any text, but as stated earlier, translation feedback can mess up some stuff with roblox! If you record your screen once you enter/exit translation feedback, you'll see that for a few frames, a lot of stuff aren't loading. However, one thing that is loaded is a set of letters, which says<br> "NITHNHWNOLGQHWNTWPEHPJKQKMOASGJLHWXJNVJBSSILYRJKORKBKOFAJGJDCW<br>QGIZI".</p>

![image again](/images/secretuniverse/barla.png)

<p>If you decrypt this with VIGEVOIAKJSDFFJASDKEY as the key, you get the following text:</p>

<p>SANDSTONE CONCRETE MUD ROCK GRASS WATER SAND GROUND SNOW GRASS LAVA GRASS SLATE</p>

<p>If you know anything about roblox, these are materials that are used in the starter place! You need to step on them in the following order in order to get it: (Remember, you can't step on other materials, and you just need to stand on them.)</p>

![guide](/images/secretuniverse/guided.png)

<p>Or if you prefer a text based guide:</p>
<p>1. Detonate and explode a subspace tripmine at point 1, where it exposes the brown spot (sandstone), and white spot (mud)</p>
<p>2. Once you do so, step at point 1.</p>
<p>3. Use coil to get outside and step on the concrete at point 2</p>
<p>4. Use coil again to step on the white part at point 3</p>
<p>5. (at this point just keep the coil on unless stated otherwise) Use the coil and step on the rock at point 4.</p>
<p>6. From here, you can touch the grass anywhere. The grass is counted as point 5, but make sure you don't touch any other materials.</p>
<p>7. From the grass, jump straight into the water at point 6 (with coil on), and hold jump to immediately head to point 7. This is to prevent you from touching the bottom of the water.</p>
<p>8. From point 7, deploy a tripmine and do a tripmine jump with coil to head to point 8.</p>
<p>9. From point 8, head to a side of the mountain where you can jump with the coil and touch the snow without touching any other texture, which is point 9 here.</p>
<p>10. From here, you can jump to the grass again and walk freely. You want to make your way to the other side of the map with lava, and jump to it. That will be point 11.</p>
<p>11. From the lava, jump back to the grass, and head to point 13 on the map, where you can see slate texture on the side of the map. You need to touch the slate texture from grass.</p>

<p>Once you do so, you will get the secret! Horray!</p>

<p>This one is a bit fun, but conceptually a lot of people have tried this last update. The peculiar box mentioned comes from Half Measures, and it resembles the subspace tripmine.

<p>This is a try-things-out secret, but if you see the badge icon, one of the thoughts that you'd have is "it has to be related to the running track in dimension 3", in a way.

<p>Once you start the race, however, the maximum speed to fill in the bar becomes 12. That's a bit weird, isn't it?</p>

<p>Going through the second checkpoint, the maximum speed to fill in the bar becomes 4.</p>

![MaxSpeed3](/images/secretuniverse/maxspeed3.png)

<p>Turns out, each gate changes the maximum speed to fill in the bar, in this following order:</p><br>
<p>12 4 8 10 9 2 7 13 11 16 14 2 5 3 6 15 1</p><br>

<li>Official Solution: Escape the panopticon by spawning inside an invisible brick and die to the void in Secret Meetup.</li>
<li>Unlocks: Supermasive Black Hole</li>
</ul>
<p>Right, lets get back to business. If there's one obvious thing that wasn't used, it's the Secret Meetup text.</p>

![iamge of sm](/images/secretuniverse/chudsm.png)

<p>One of them has a different color. If you search up the hex color from it, you get #68719F. Googling this hex code, you get a song by Koronba. An interesting thing is that this song also plays in Secret Universe! Specifically, in Secret Meetup. If you go to Secret Meetup, you can get the ID of the song playing. What you have to do is wait for "Koronba - 68719F" to play, then extract the ID! How? Well, in the Memory tab, there is a folder that lists the ID of anything playing at any given point, and that is in the Sounds folder.</p>

![sounds](/images/secretuniverse/glorp.png)

We can see that an ID is shown, which is [91098270480451](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/91098270480451/koronba-68719F). In the description of the file, you get "-85, 939, -148" (if it's not shown or is privated, i suggest using an extension or using an API to view it).

<p>What do I do from here? Well, if you try to get to the coordinates in secret meetup (you can do so by dance clipping outside, and using Shift+Fn+F3 (remove the Fn if you're on windows) followed by Shift+1, up until you get to see your coordinates on the top left of your screen), you'll find that there's...nothing?</p>

![image](/images/secretuniverse/prong.png)

<p>Well, you'll have to note down where you're standing on the panopticon. This will be important for later.</p>

![loll idk what to naem anymore](/images/secretuniverse/align.png)

<p>It's worth noting that where you're supposed to be standing is on the middle part here, where I'm standing.</p>

![meowe](/images/secretuniverse/align2.png)

<p>Then head down, align your camera with where I'm standing. Got it? Now, go back to Secret Universe, and go to Dimension-1, if you have it (you can get it from the DIMENSION-1 secret). Once you do so, go and head to the same coordinates. On top of the panopticon. You can get there by using tripmine + gravity coil, or you can get there by growing the sapling. Once you're at that location (and you've double checked you're at the right location), press the trade button and teleport to trading hub. If you have done everything right, you should spawn on an invisible brick with darkness surrounding you. Once you do so, just keep running into the void, and die to the void.</p>

<li>Unlocks: Subspace Bubble</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally for me, this was a bit too hard of a secret (and it's also annoying). First of all, you need to have the Snowball structure from Artful Dodger. Additionally, this secret is also made WAY easier with Fortress Walls from Ground Zero, and I will showcase the tutorial with the Fortress Walls.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do this is to aim the snowball to the exit opposite to it.</p>

![Opposite](/images/secretuniverse/shitting.png)

<p>Then, subspace it such that it gets flung and stuck behind the walls. Push it to the balcony, wait for the snowball color to turn white, then push it off. Once you do so, jump into the void. You'll see that there is a snowball at the center of the other side. Touch it, let the credits roll, and you'll get the secret!</p>

<p>"How do you figure this out" you may ask, and the solution to that is...try things out yourself. Mostly from the fact that subspacing it to the void directly changes the environment you're in.</p>

(See the icon for Hackerman and Debugge/r). This gives us a starting point, to check in the console. But where do we look?</p>
<p>Well, one of the places we can look at is the memory tab, since we haven't used it. If you dig enough, you'll find this script:</p>

![Imagesidk what to name this](/images/secretuniverse/puth2ing.png)

<p>PropUserThreadHumanoidScroller. What is the acronym for that? PUTHS. Wow, confirmer! From here, what you want to do is decode the morse inside of the memory graph. But how, you might ask? Well, the dots run for 1, dashes run for 3, short pauses run for 2, and long pauses run for 5 garbage collection cycles. In other words, to simplify your decoding, if there is a peak lasting for less than 10 dots, you interpret it as a dot. If there is a peak lasting for more than 10 dots, you interpret it as a dash. If there is a valley lasting for less than 10 dots, you don't give space in between the characters, and if there is a valley lasting for more than 10 dots, you give a space.</p>

<p>This might take VERY long, so bear with it. However, once you do so, you get the following string: CARPOXYDZ. What you want to do is to put this into the puths structure, and you will get the secret!</p>

> POSTPRODUCTION NOTE

<p>The following section will contain the BUFFED version of Oracle Attack, e.g. the original way the teams solved it. THIS MEANS THAT A LOT OF THE THINGS HERE ARE NOT REPLICABLE!</p>

<p>Congratulations! Now you input the old code (ZPOWKQXRT) to the puths structure, and you get the following popup:</p>

![lol](/images/secretuniverse/jh.png)

<p>Memory. Do you know what that means? Of course! It's the structure that we can see from the puthing around structure!</p>

![omg](/images/secretuniverse/sofaraway.png)

<p>Yep, it is the MemoryMoneyMaker 9000. But what do we do? Well, try to step on the pads, such as stepping on Z for example. If you do so, you'll see that the memory spikes up by 3 MB. That's weird. What about the one above, H? Well, if you step on H, you'll see that the memory also spikes up, but by 17 MB this time. Well, you can think of it as a substitution cipher! Remember the code that we get from earlier? Because Z outputted 3 MB, you can A1Z26 it to get C. So Z -> C, and so on, until you get the answer of CARPOXYDZ.</p>

<p>Let's start with something that we left off from the previous update. The sapling. If you try to play with it in this update, you'll see that there's one branch on the sapling (if you grow it enough) that is colored white. If you go to dimension-7, you'll see that the location of this white sapling is conveniently in the clouds. Clicking on it gives you a cloud item. You can use this to spawn balls that merge into a giant ball.</p>

<li>Official Solution: Solve the puzzle obtained from touching the Snowball with different tools and complete the specified task.</li>
<li>Unlocks: Tesla Coil</li>
</ul>
<p>Paraphernalia is a term to describe a group of equipment or tools. In SU, you can interpret this as having a few gears. Because this was update on the dimension-7 update, it is related to something there. One thing that has an interaction with gears is the snowball. For example, if you show the snowball a teddy bear, it will say "Can we be friends?". However, some gears have an interesting response attached to them.</p>

![Speed Coil](/images/secretuniverse/coilogy.png)

<p>For example, showing the snowball a speed coil prompts it to say 1-7. There are a handful of other things that has this interaction as well. Which are as follows:</p>
<p><br>
Regen: 2-2, 2-5, 3-6, 1-8<br>
Speed: 1-7<br>
Cloud: 1-1, 3-4<br>
Clover: 4-3<br>
</p>

<p>What does this mean? Well, this might sound like a stretch, but when you run out of things to try, you'll end up going through the tooltip of the items. Now, you may ask:</p>

![Speedcoil TT](/images/secretuniverse/coiltt.png)

<p>What tooltip? Looks normal...</p>
<br>
<p>I'm glad you asked! I wasn't talking about the tooltip IN secret universe, I'm talking about the tooltip of these items! Roblox rarely gives out tooltips to gears, and coincidentally, these four has a tooltip related to them! You can check this by going in another game and giving the gear to yourself (or in my case, I went to Catalog Avatar Creator and gave myself these items), and you can see the following:</p>
<br>
<p>April Showers (in SU, this is cloud):</p>

![April Shower](/images/secretuniverse/aprilshowers.png)

<p>Speed Coil:</p>

![Speed](/images/secretuniverse/seed.png)

<p>Regeneration Coil:</p>

![Regen](/images/secretuniverse/resk.png)

<p>Lucky Clover:</p>

![Clover](/images/secretuniverse/kena.png)

<p>Now that we have these, we can apply book cipher to these description!</p>

<br>

<p><br>
Cloud:  1-1 -> Bring<br>
Regen:  2-2 -> 4<br>
Clover: 4-3 -> lucky<br>
Cloud:  3-4 -> flowers<br>
Regen:  2-5 -> 4<br>
Regen:  3-6 -> the<br>
Speed:  1-7 -> speed<br>
Regen:  1-8 -> reskin<br>
</p>

<br>

<p>Bring 4 lucky flowers 4 the speed reskin. And tesla coil is the reskin, so this has got to be for paraphernalia! What you need to do from now is to get 4 lucky clovers (you can do this by dropping the clover, unequipping it from the inventory menu then equipping again, then picking up the dropped clover) and show it to the snowball! (dont forget to equip all 4 and interact with the snowball)</p>

New Secret Universe update! I wonder where to start… Could you kindly tell me the Very Useful Update Board?

![dim2](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/dim2.png)

Well, thanks, I guess. Let's head to dimension 2 now.

Upon going into dimension 2, you can see this subspace tripmine icon on the corners of the map, similar to the ones in dimension 7. Therefore, you must place a subspace on these.

![tripmine](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/tripmine.png)

Placing all 4 subspace tripmines down will make the corners shoot beams up into the sky and make the skybox purple. Keith also falls down from the sky onto the baseplate:

![keith](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/keithnoway.png)

Talking to him and saying “Yes” will trigger a cutscene, and after some dialogue, he will send you to...

<div class="sub-chapter-title">Anything Can Be A Secret</div>

Upon joining the game, you can notice right away that there is a guy sitting on the picnic blanket and glitching out:

![omg](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/divideetimpera.png)

Talking to them flips the world on its side, Finn McCube will spawn with.. a lot of dialogue to go through but he does give you an Absolutely Safe Capsule for the realms that contain the puzzles.

![capsule](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/idle.png)

Let's take a breather now to see what comes next. Before that, let's address the obvious.

The capsule has 6 worlds in total: Underflow, The Furnace, Cobalt Temple, Great Circuit, Lovely Little Town, Blazhenstvo.

![worlds](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/plee.png)

From here on, the puzzle will be non-linear but they’ll converge at the end.

Before you start with your journey, get to Lovely Little Town first. Once you’re in Lovely Little Town, grab the Speed Coil from the item giver nearby. Trust me, this will help you a lot.

Once done, go to Cobalt Temple. Once you're there, head upstairs and go to the right, you’ll see this circle with 6 colors and a few lines connecting them:

![rgb](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/rbg.png)

<br>
Green - Lovely Little Town<br>
Red - Underflow<br>
Purple - Blazhenstvo<br>
Orange - The Furnace<br>
Cyan - Great Circuit<br>
Blue - Cobalt Library<br>

From this, we see that Blue and Red take us to 2 separate paths. Therefore, the guide will be split into separate parts too. You can do these parts before one another, it doesn’t really matter. But before we do anything, let's go visit Underflow first and see what we'll be dealing with.

Upon arriving at Underflow, go straight and to the right, you’ll see a Terminus:

![terminus](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/terminus.png)

On the floor of the Terminus, there is an eye symbol with 2 clickable parts on it.

![eyes](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/eyes.png)

Clicking on either of them yield these dialogues:

![doc](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/doc.png)

This will make sense later. Go back to Cobalt Temple.

<div class="sub-sub-title">Horror Path (Punishment for Diversion)</div>

Going left, we see a staircase going up and a small room to the side. The small room has an NPC called “Xander”. Talking to him about the closet, you’ll find out that apparently the closet is a sentient MONSTER... and also he put some of Bill’s remains upstairs. This is the clue indicating that we must go upstairs to progress instead, but let’s not do that just yet since we still have another dialogue option with Xander.

Picking to talk about his diary, he’ll talk about how he only writes letters in them, he’s not allowed to touch any books except “the safer ones” that he flipped. 

Going upstairs and into the main room, to our right we’ll see a desk with a skull next to it. This is Bill’s skull. Xander’s diary lay next to it. There aren’t much things to note except for these lines from page 3, 4 and 8:

![book1](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/book1.png)

![book2](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/book2.png)

![book3](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/book3.png)

If we look to our left, we can see a bookshelf with a few books flipped. These must be the “safer books” Xander is referring to; you can interact with them. On top of one of the shelves, we can see a yellow triangle with a top hat next to it:

![cill](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/cill.png)

These are Bill’s possessions. Hold on a second… His name is “Bill” he has a triangle and a top hat… Surely this is referencing “Bill Cipher” from Gravity Falls. If you look at page 4 of Xander’s diary, he talks about writing the word “MONSTER” in colorful books. Well, there is a Color Code in Gravity Falls. If we use [this](https://www.dcode.fr/gravity-falls-colors) website, encode the text “MONSTER”, we get these sets of colors:

![monster](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/monstah.png)

Additionally, these colors match up to the set of the clickable books on the shelf under the triangle!

![book](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/books.png)

Once we enter the code, the painting next to the bookshelves disappears and we’ll be able to go inside. Inside, there's an NPC named “Motte”, who will give you valuable information about the puzzle.

If you ask about Sculpture, he’ll talk about capturing their Emotions and how they’re essential. If you ask about Emotions, he’ll give you the Emote UI. If you ask about the Map... nothing useful.

Looking to the right, you’ll see these sculptures:

![emote](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/omg.png)

They’re emotes. The left one is /e point, the middle is /e cheer and the right one is /e laugh. On the left, you see this tall block stack and an unfinished sculpture:

![emote2](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/omg2.png)

From here, we can deduce that there is an input, and the input is most likely inputting from the highest podium to the lowest podium's emotes. 

In the middle, we see this map:

![map](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/maps.png)

This is a map for the location “Lovely Little Town”. Let’s head there next.

Behind spawn, you can see an area with a house that has no entrance. If you compare this area with the map, they completely match up, so this is the location we’re looking for.

Now, go to these locations and do these following emotes (actually you only need to stand on one of those locations and do the emotes but just pretend you need to go to those locations):

![map2](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/map2.png)

You’ll know you’ve done it right when you hear the Weird Route Jingle from Deltarune the emote UI is taken away from you. The next step according to the map is to go inside the chimney of the house. Going inside, you’ll see a table with a coin on top. Pick it up.

Once done, go out the chimney (there's an invisible ladder). If you go towards the treehouse, you’ll see an NPC named Bryant who sells Lemonade. You need 25 cents in order to buy a lemonade and unfortunately the coin is only 1 cent... You’ll need to get the other 24 somewhere. But where? Well, let's move on for a bit. Going towards the direction of the lighthouse, you’ll see a dock with the NPC Gnawbert. He needs a lemonade. There’s an obvious connection here. 

Let’s think about what to do with the coin. If you go back to where the Absolutely Safe Capsule is and going to the top left area where there’s a water fountain with coins inside, you’ll get a clue:

![dialog](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/dialog.png)

This is hinting towards the well. Going behind Bryant, you’ll see an open field with a red car, to the right of the car would be the well.

![well](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/well.png)

Throwing your coin into the well will give you a quarter... magically. And you won't question that. 

With this quarter, you can now buy lemonade from Bryant and give it to Gnawbert. After you give Gnawbert the lemonade, he’ll offer you a fishing lesson. Accept it and sit on the chair next to him. Finish the dialogue, and the true horror begins. The town will no longer be bright and cheerful. You are then instructed to go home. But what home? Well, upon exploring, we can see that the closed-off house is now open. From here, go to the house that you previously jumped into the chimney, its doors are now open for you.

There is a camera inside. Picking it up starts the horror sequence. Your camera will be in first person and there will be a static filter on your screen.

![camera](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/camera.png)

Your objective? Survive (and also collect the keys scattered across the maze. For reference, here is a diagram of the maze:)

![map](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/map.png)

![layout](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/layout.png)

(Credits to glitchfox999)

The darker gray means lockers. Why are there lockers? Well, you are not safe. You are not alone.

Let’s talk about the entities you’ll be encountering.

<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="entity-tag">$%&$# (yes, that is its name.)</span>
        <br>
		<img src="/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/cheeee.png" alt="Scarything" class="entity-img">
		<br>
$%&$# is an entity that spawns when you collect the first key. It will roam around the maze while you try and collect keys. It emits a <b>red glow</b> and a <b>static noise</b> when you’re nearby. It instantly kills you upon contact. If it spots you, you’ll be slowed down and it will speed up. It’s recommended that you hide in lockers when you see or hear this entity. Only come out when you’re 100% sure it's gone. (AKA when you don’t hear the static anymore)
    </li>
	<li>
		<span class="entity-tag">Prunsel</span>
		<br>
		<img src="/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/chee2.png" alt="scary2" class="entity-img">
		<br>
		Prunsel spawns after you collect your 3rd key. He will always appear near you. When you look at him, he takes away all your audio. He can’t kill you. 
	</li>
</ul>

Now let’s talk about the keys.

The first key will ALWAYS be random. You should take your time memorizing the layout instead of rushing to get the key in this time. After that, it’ll say the following text:

<b>“the attic key has relocated somewhere [text]”</b>

Depending on the text, you’ll want to go to these areas:

cozy = green<br>
warm = orange<br>
dull = white<br>
cold = blue<br>
black = random, it can spawn in any area.<br><br>

Once you’re done with all of that, you’ll be teleported to the attic. In front of you is the table with a mysterious object. Pick it up.

![the end](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/tehend.png)


GG! You’ve done the horror path!

<div class="sub-sub-title">Logic Path (Disregard for Existence)</div>

Now, the Cobalt Temple says there is a hint here relating to The Furnace. We’re not sure where this is yet so we’ll just head to “The Furnace” as the next destination.

To the top left of spawn, there’s a hidden structure we can go into:

![pyramid](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/pyranmimd.png)

Going inside, we can see this grid along with a button:

![grid](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/ooo.png)

There’s also an NPC named Gear here that can help you with the puzzle- nevermind they’re just gone. They did have a message for us, which is to come back later. Great. 

Well, there’s nothing much to do here, so let’s just go to the neighbouring area: Great Circuit.

To the right of spawn, we can see a base. Going into the base and going upstairs, there’s an NPC named Philip staring at a painting.

![base](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/base.png)

He says that "pixel art will stay relevant and amusing for ages...no, generations to come!". That's interesting, because if you had messed with the button from the furance, you'll notice that it says "42 generations later", after some time clicking the button. Interesting. 

![pixel](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/pixel.png)

Let's go back to the great furnace.

![note](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/note.png)

Ah, there’s a note where Gear used to be. This note will help solve whatever puzzle’s going on here. Inside of it, there are multiple questions.

Q1: Do you know how this machine works?<br>
Well, this is.. NOT Conway’s Game of Life. This is cellular automata with its own unique rules..

Q2: Have you met Louie and his comrades?<br>
We definitely haven’t. Gear will hint to us where Louie is. He says that Louie is a Wall Dweller. This means that Louie and his comrades aren’t in “The Furnace”. They can either be in Cobalt Temple or Great Circuit. Let’s continue the questionnaire before we leave.

Q3: Have you found an external tool- er, online simulator, that this machine is designed around?<br>
If you answer no here, you’ll be asked with subquestions.

Q3.1: If you haven’t, does a certain anagram of “his mind” being the author of said simulator ring a bell?<br>
Q3.2: The simulator has to do with stepping through cell configurations on a grid, from one state to another. This process is reversible as well. This is not a question.<br>

The anagram we’re looking for is “dmishin”. They’re the author of [this](https://dmishin.github.io/js-revca/) site. The site will be useful in the solving of this puzzle.

Q4: Did you know that the top-left corner of the machine’s grid corresponds to the top-left corner of said simulator’s grid?<br>
This is just a fact question.

Q5: Did you make sure to input the configuration, and then go in reverse, one step at a time, until no longer necessary?<br>
Answer “no” for a hint:<br>
“If it helps, the first step in reverse should turn the configuration into a square with a single stray cell in the middle.”

Q6: Did you answer each of these questions with exemplary honesty, loyalty, courage, and cat, and how?<br>
Just answer yes on this one to end the dialogue.

Now then, the first order of business is finding Louie and his gang. Let’s go to Cobalt Temple. Gear of Guidance says that Louie is a wall dweller… Well, if you look upstairs on the left side emblem (next to Russell), you can see this hole in the wall:

![aaa](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/aaa.png)

![i got lazy to write alt text](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/aab.png)



You can fit your character inside here (use first person). Inside is the rats hideout. Talk to Margolus, he has the dialogue you need:

![aah](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/aac.png)

The dialogue says "Critters rule!", which is funny, because if we go back to the website earlier, we can find that critters rule is actually a valid rule! Go to the Reversible cellular automata site, set the rule to “Critters”. Adjust the Step, press “Step Forward” (▶️) until your Generation is at 42.

![aah](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/tut.png)

Insert in the painting in a 6x6 cell like so:

![pixel2](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/pixel2.png)

Press “Step Backwards” until your Generation is 0:

![aah](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/tut2.png)

That cell pattern is the answer. Input it onto the board in The Furnace.

![pattern](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/pattern.png)

Then, press the button until it says “42 generations later”. You’ll know you’ve done it when the cells turn red.

Now, let’s go back to Great Circuit and see what’s changed.

Oh. Well, the whole place’s on lockdown now. Around the place, there are debug terminals that you can debug. Debugging makes you do warioware-like minigames.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Concentrate</div>

Click to reveal cards. Match the corresponding cards. There are only 4 cards in total: Ace of Spades, Ace of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds and Ace of Hearts.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Line Up!</div>

Align ANY developer (KrizisHQ, zHary, robey100) faces correctly by timing your clicks.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Memorize!</div>

Complete the Simon Says color wheel minigame. (AKA repeat what it shows)

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Spell!</div>

It’s just Squaredle.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Swat!</div>

Click on the flies to swat them. Swat all the flies to complete the minigame.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Jump!</div>

Jump over obstacles and get to the end. Click to jump. Hold click to float higher.

If you ever fail any minigames, it’ll say “TOTAL MISPLAY” on the screen and you’ll have to restart that minigame. If you succeed, it’ll say “HACK SUCCESS” and you can move on.

Once you’re done with the terminals, the core will explode and you’ll be taken to the white void.

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/oh.png)

Press the green button a few times. It’ll ask you for a password. If you look up at the “CIRCUIT INTEGRITY CRITICAL” text, you’ll see some of the letters flickering:

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/jtoh.png)

They spell out “UNREALITY”. That’s the password. Confirm the password then go to Underflow. Now that you have both puzzles done, head to the structure with the valve. You’ll see the pattern surrounding the eye has turned white. Interact with the valve and continue.

Falling down takes you to the Coin Challenge where you have to collect all 424 coins in the obby. There are things that cripples you or gives you a distraction. These are (in chronological order):

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Killbricks (in the obby)</div>

Just avoid them.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">osu!</div>

Click the circles when the outer ring is near the circle.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Simon Says</div>

Follow what it says. There are only a few basic commands<br>
1) …hold your ground. (Do/don’t touch the ground) <br>
2) …take your leave. (Do/don’t move left) <br>
3) …carry onward (Do/don’t move forward) <br>
4) …right your wrongs. (Do/don’t move right) <br>
5) …stall for time (Do/don’t stop pressing your movement keys) <br>

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Advertisement</div>

Just close the ad.

These will pop out of the ground. Avoid touching them.

If you lose this challenge too many times, you’ll be given more time to do the challenge. This will give you 2 more minutes the first time so you’ll have 11 minutes instead of 9, then it’ll give you 3 more minutes, making it 14 minutes and so on.

After you complete the coin challenge, you’ll be taken to the Crimson Arena where you have to fight Crimson Star.

At least that’s what the game wants you to think. You just need to survive until you’re taken to Outlined Normal Realm.

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/outline.png)

Talk to the Rhombus of Remorse (at the picnic blanket), he’ll give you the Capsule back for you to go to the next part of the secret.

<div class="sub-chapter-title">That One Secret Game</div>

Joining TOSG, you’ll see a glitchy dock and a boat with a person in it. Go in the boat and wait till the ride is over. Take a breather. You’ll be taken to the obby afterwards.

The goal is to beat the obby. Touching the radio will reveal more paths, therefore, just follow the radio. Dying will restart the obby.

Completing the obby will give you an end screen. Click continue then go into the cave. In the caves, there are 2 puzzles that you need to solve: the Slider puzzle and Lights Out.

For the slider puzzle, you can solve it manually or use a puzzle solver like [this](https://puzzlenum.com/solver/sliding-puzzle/) site.

Similarly, for lights out, you can solve it yourself or use a puzzle solve like [this](https://www.dcode.fr/lights-out-solver).

After you solve both puzzles, the elevator will open up, allowing you to progress to the next game.

<div class="sub-chapter-title">A Game Of Secrets</div>

The elevator will bring you into a secret underground facility. To the left is our first puzzle:

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/ohok.png)

The module has a 5 digit module we need to render. This is random for every person, on every attempt.

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/lol.png)

There’s a reference we can use below the board:

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/lol3.png)

To render the number, we must first visualize what the number would look like on the board. The number I got is 69986, therefore, the board would look like this:

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/number.png)

Once you’ve visualized the render, use the calculator to get the base-10 number of each row and input it in the textbox with the label “Insert base-10” on the corresponding rows.

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/binary.png)

Render out the whole board and the code will appear. Now, you can convert this binary back into decimal using the calculator but in reverse or use [this](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-decimal.html) site to convert your number.

This will be the code to the door. Input it and the door to the next puzzle will open.

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/winner.png)

The next puzzle is Loopover. 

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/ada.png)

This is a puzzle made by carykh. The goal is to make it so that letters on the grid are ordered alphabetically. You can use arrows to shift the columns up/downwards; rows left/right. However, this isn’t all to it. Sometimes, some arrows disappear. You can use the solver [here](https://pwoofy.me/tools/) to solve it!

Once you solve the grid, the letters will change to the code for the door:

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/knowledge.png)

Simply read this in reading order to get “knowledgebeginswithwonder”. Once you enter the code, you’ll be met with a cutscene… This time you’ll be defusing a bomb under a time limit.

There are 6 total modules on the bomb.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">RGB Nonogram</div>

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/ceop1.png)


Each cell has a correct color in it, ranging from Red, Green, Blue and Black. Find the colors that decrease the numbers on the rows and columns. The goal is to make every number “0”.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Hashiwokakero</div>

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/coep2.png)


Click on the lines to connect the squares. Each square has a set amount of lines it can have. You’ll know the number of lines each square needs when the squares turn yellow. The goal is to make every square yellow. After you’ve done that, some squares will flash blue. Note down the number on the squares that flashed blue. That will be the code to defuse this module.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Prime Factors</div>

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/cope3.png)

You’ll be given 6 numbers. Find their prime factors and insert the primes incrementally. After you’re done, press “Confirm All 6”.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Laser Grid</div>

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/cope4.png)

Once you press “Start”, you’ll have 10 seconds to do the explanation down below: 
There will be a number on the Vertical Axis and Horizontal Axis. Convert those numbers into binary. Input those numbers onto their respective grids.

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/explanation.png)

Then, use the “OR” logical operator on each and every cell in the grid (“OR” means that if there’s a “1”, it’s always red). Find the cells that’s “0” or black and move the cyan square to that tile. Alternatively, if you have time to input, use the solver  [here](https://pwoofy.me/tools/).

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Loopover</div>

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/cope56.png)

Same as the one in the room before the bomb. Once you solve this, the [alphabetize_the_letters] will turn into [spell_(word)]. You simply spell the word given to you by clicking on the letters. Solver is [here](https://pwoofy.me/tools/).

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Morse Code</div>

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/cope7.png)

Encode the word given to you into morse code and confirm each letter into the module. (The morse tree is for visual on whether or not you entered the letter correctly or not). Once you have defused the bomb, go back to the elevator whence you came and you’ll be teleported to the last part of the Secret Multiverse part 1 event.

<div class="sub-chapter-title">How Many Ways Can You Join This Roblox Game</div>

Once you join the game, you’ll see a BIG RED EVIL BUTTON right in front of you.

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/dama.png)

Pressing it will send you to the EVIL version of the game: How Many Ways Can You LEAVE This Roblox Game? The premise is simple. Find 4 ways to leave the game.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Method 1: Leave</div>

The first way you can do it is ESC + L + Enter (or Menu -> Leave -> Leave). You’ll be rewarded with a structure when you rejoin.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Method 2: Leave</div>

The second way is to Alt + F4 (must wait until the join text disappears). This structure will appear when you rejoin.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Method 3: Disconnect(?)</div>

The third way is to afk for 20 minutes or use the Time Singularity by inputting “42” on it and activating it.

<div class="sub-sub-sub-title">Method 4: Kicked</div>

The final way is to get kicked by a neon brick behind the “Welcome to HELL” sign.

Once you’ve done all that, go through the door at the middle structure. You’ll be teleported to Easiest Game Ever! evil version. Walk across the planks and into the portal.

<div class="sub-chapter-title">Checkpoint</div>

After you’ve been thrown straight into the camera, go across the gap, go to where the portal was.

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/theend.png)

You’ll be forced into first person while you go down the tunnel. Go straight and talk to Keith.

![oh](/images/secretuniverse/secretmultiverse/keith1.png)

Follow him back in Secret Universe, and...

Congratulations you’ve finished the longest secret in the entire game!
