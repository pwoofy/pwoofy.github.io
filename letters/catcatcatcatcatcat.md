In terms of impact, next to Verna, I think you had the biggest effect on my life.

I'm very happy to be friends with you, Jen (or nat). I really am!!!!! cause to be honest i didnt have anyone to stay with for furum. furum was nice. genuinely one of the best experiences ive ever had with someone. im sorry i never got to hug you for longer, i feel like you deserved it...

furum was really cool, because we got to explore a lot of stuff, met a lot of new and old friends, and just genuinely strolling around was fun.

sorry if i gave you anxiety during furum though(?), but i still hope you enjoyed your time..

outside of furum, thanks for being a person i can share my honest opinion on some stuff (admittedly, i think i see myself for being too honest in some scenarios)

but anyways, i appreciate you! hopefully i get my fursuit, and hopefully you'll be there for next year whether or not i have my fursuit :3

you're one of the coolest friends ive had the chance of knowing more this year
