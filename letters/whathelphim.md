hi

happy new year, i would write a lot more but to be honest i do feel like we havent done much this year...

i still do remember the times when we've had actual talks that kind of made me reflect more about life, when i was much younger as well. that was something good that i missed. i wish we did more of that this year, but i guess not?

i do remember those write a letter days like it was yesterday though, i still have a lot of your notes saved because i thought it was that important

it ended up being important! i mean, that time i couldnt move past pako, and im grateful i got to move on past pako. like, i think i was put on a chokehold of trying to see if i could go back

i never went back, and thats for a good reason. had i went back, i wouldnt be with verna, so i guess thank you for helping me move on.

i do wish that we could still talk normally though
