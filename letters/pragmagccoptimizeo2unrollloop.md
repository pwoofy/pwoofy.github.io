Hello, Grumpy.

I know that this year, we haven't been talking to each other as much, or playing like we used to.

To be honest, I do miss playing write a letter. That was really fun TBH, but I think that's a matter of the past now.

Thank you for filling this 2025 with...quite a lot of eventful things. I know in the past I've hated you, but I think you've became one of the more integral people in my life now lol

From puzzling together, solving together, developing together, a lot of my career wouldn't exist if it weren't because of you. I guess the everlasting impact that you have made on me is that crucial.

I hope you're doing well in real life though! I know you have been doing well in CTFs and whatnot? I think you'll be able to get a career in it in the future, I believe in that! 

Additionally, I do wish you the best with practically everything else! I'd ask to watch house MD, but I'm...kind of back in my indo house so I can't do that. I'd like to do much more though, but I think I have gotten much busier throughout the years. I think I will be busier??? I don't know, I'm a bit occupied with university, but I don't mind spending more time with you :3

To be honest, I'm still looking forward to meet you in real life, perhaps we can mai together some day? Or perhaps I can come visit for whatever reason, that would be funny

Anyways, have a nice 2026! I appreciate you, if I haven't said that 200 times yet!
