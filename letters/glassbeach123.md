hi xero (or kelsey, i don't know what you prefer)

i never expected to get closer to knowing you in 2025 actually, but here we are.

i'm so happy to have you as not only part of GBTL, but part of glaceon as well. i know everyone has moved on from glaceon, as in the server itself, but i still remember you. aside from being very very good at puzzles from all ranges between research to logic, you are also one of the nicest people i know. probably much nicer than what i could be. it kind of reminds me of verna if he started swearing and if he was transgender LOL

i believe im not the only person to be grateful to have you around. im sure a lot of people are very grateful of your existence. the groupchat would not be for me if it weren't for your personality that made it nicer (although you're crazy, so is everyone else). additionally, i think you're the only person in that group chat that ever listens to me, or anyone else for that matter. i think your caring attitude is probably one of the best things to come out from you.

i don't know how life is going on with you, i think i've seen some part of your struggles, but that's not enough for me to know the entire scope. and because of that, i hope this year treats you better than before. i do feel like i need to give back to you in some way, or in whatever way after dealing with my younger self's bullshit(???)

so in that note, if you ever need to reach out to anyone, do try to reach out, Xero. your life matters, and i'd like to tell you that a lot of people love you for varying ways.

i'm letting you know about that, because i know in this day and age a lot of people are insecure about themselves, but i hope you get to see the other parts of you that are admirable and loved by many others.

and lastly, i hope you'll learn to be happier about yourself, and i hope you're satisfied with yourself, however long it takes.
