Hello, Verna.

Let me re-introduce myself.

![Me](/images/ocimages/paw.png)

I'm pwoofy. Some people know me as snappy, or trism, or whatever comes before that. But you're the only person that knows me as another thing: 

A cat? Perhaps your cat?

Jokes aside, thanks for making 2025 a nice year. Earlier during christmas, I wrote very little. It's because I saved them for this. I'm pretty sure I have told you everything I've always wanted to say in the past, and that is because I say the same stuff. This time, I want to state something different.

I'm very happy to have the opportunity to be with you. A lot, actually. I'm always looking back at all the memories we've made. 

Do know that when times are tough, let me know, okay?

I'll always try to listen to you. 

I'll always try to give priority to you. I suppose in a way, I treat you like I would treat a cat. I would take care of you.

Sorry if I haven't done much, I really tried. 

I guess there's not much for me to say now. I've always wanted to jot down everything I'm thinking of, such as how my world would have been very different without you.

Perhaps I wouldn't exist? What if we never met? There's a lot of universes out there where we haven't met, and god knows what happens there.

But for now, I know that in this universe, we are together.

I know that at this time, we are together. And I hope this stays forever.

Thanks for wanting to play skyblock with me!

Thanks for wanting to play roblox with me!

Thanks for letting me share unforgettable memories with you.

Truly, you are a special gift.

I'll cherish you forever, even if we're apart.
